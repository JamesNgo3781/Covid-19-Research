Children sit under the shade of a tree in Biliran in the Philippines one of the most deforested countries on the planet. Around them are seedlings planted in an effort to fight climate change. Trees absorb carbon through their leaves as part of photosynthesis.

At age 9 Felix Finkbeiner planted his first tree. 

He had just learned about Wangari Maathai a Kenyan woman who won the Nobel Peace Prize for leading an effort to plant 30 million trees in Africa. The boy was struck by her message — that trees are powerful allies in the fight to curb global warming.

Some of the more sophisticated details went over his head Finkbeiner recalled. But he said he “understood the tree-planting part.” So in 2007 he dug a hole in front of his school near Munich and inserted a crab-apple sapling. “I thought that we kids should be planting some trees as well” he said.

Finkbeiner’s fourth-grade awakening blossomed into a personal crusade and eventually birthed a tree-planting foundation Plant for the Planet. The organization which is responsible for planting millions of new trees around the world is part of a growing constellation of campaigns that seek to reforest every continent except Antarctica.

Driven by the recognition that trees suck Earth-warming carbon out of the atmosphere far more efficiently than any machine the effort has attracted millions of dollars in support — and inspired hope that trees could become an even more potent weapon in the battle against climate change.

“We’ve been astonished to find that it is up there with all the best climate change solutions” said ETH Zurich ecologist Thomas Crowther thesis adviser to Finkbeiner now a 22-year-old PhD student in environmental science. Plant for the Planet inherited a massive tree-planting program renamed the Trillion Tree Campaign from the United Nations in 2011 Crowther is its chief scientific adviser.

On Tuesday in Davos Switzerland President Trump said the United States would join 1t.org a new project launched by the World Economic Forum to connect the Trillion Tree Campaign and other reforestation programs around the world.

“In doing so we will continue to show strong leadership in restoring growing and better managing our trees and our forests” said Trump who last year suggested devastating wildfires in California could have been avoided by raking the forest floors. 

Greta Thunberg the 17-year-old climate activist who was in the audience when Trump spoke said planting trees is good but no solution to global warming. Thunberg and others say countries and industries must stop emitting carbon now and switch to solar wind and other clean energy.

“Avoiding climate breakdown will require cathedral thinking. We must lay the foundation while we may not know exactly how to build the ceiling.”

Most environmentalists including those involved in reforestation would agree with that sentiment. Still tree planting offers a simple accessible low-tech idea with wide appeal.

In October YouTube broadcaster Jimmy Donaldson who goes by MrBeast launched a campaign to raise $20 million to plant 20 million trees. Billionaire Elon Musk donated $1 million and temporarily changed his Twitter handle to “Treelon.” In July Ethiopia broke a world record for the most trees planted in a day when officials said 23 million peopleplanted 350 million trees.

Trees are the most efficient carbon-capture machines on the planet. Through photosynthesis they absorb carbon dioxide t

As at January 10 the  death toll had stood at 38 persons while the new toll reflects  confirmed influenza deaths up to January 17.

As of the latter  date the cumulative number of vaccines administered to the public for  this flu season was at 67867 compared to 60256 on January 10.

The number of suspected influenza cases for the 2020 calendar year also as of Friday January 17 stood at 29 cases up from 17.

The number of suspected influenza cases for the 2019 calendar year was 3755 persons.

The  Ministry continues to engage in an aggressive campaign to increase  vaccination rates and again reminds the population that the vaccine is  considered safe even for persons within “at-risk” groups.

These  include pregnant women persons with chronic illnesses such as Diabetes  Mellitus those with respiratory illnesses such as asthma and  compromised immune systems persons over the age of 65 and children  aged six months to five years.

Health care workers and those in essential services are also encouraged to get the flu vaccine.

**Coronavirus: Don’t panic**

Health  Minister Terrence Deyalsingh has also advised that Trinidad and Tobago  need not panic over the so-called “Wuhan virus” emerging out of that  district in China a deadly respiratory illness believed to be a case of  (zoonotic) transmission from animals to humans.

However  Deyalsingh said the Ministry will go forth with an abundance of caution  and he has given instructions for added precaution at Piarco  International Airport and on flights arriving from that district.

Deyalsingh  said there will be changes by tomorrow to forms that pilots are  obligated to complete which will now require them to report an incident  on board an aircraft of passengers who have suddenly fallen ill and are  presenting with a fever.

Any passenger suspected of the virus  would be checked on at the airport by a country medical officer with  isolation capacities ready at Caura Chest Hospital and at the new  College of Science Technology and Applied Arts of Trinidad and Tobago  (COSTATT) building in Port of Spain.

Deyalsingh said the Ministry  is also working with the Airports Authority and starting today thermal  scanners will be employed at the airport for flights arriving from  Asia.

Asking citizens not to panic Deyalsingh said vigilance was also being stepped up at the ports including screening.

“If  in the unlikely event that we do have a person coming down with  symptoms which are similar to what is being experienced in Asia we have  the capacity to isolate and treat with it” said the Minister.

Deyalsingh  said he will be visiting the airport on Thursday to ensure that all  precautions are in place and working and to see whether more caution is  needed.

“But at this point there is no need for panic” he said  though noting that while the virus appears to be isolated to parts of  Asia at this time caution was still being taken as some possibility had  appeared of human-to-human transmission.","569526170_VK_2711824605559893","sheldon.awai"

 300 people in China have already been infected by the virus which turns into a pneumonia and does not respond to antibiotic treatment. 

The first case was reported in the US today. 

“Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that are common among animals. In rare cases they are what scientists call zoonotic meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Coronavirus symptoms

The viruses can make people sick usually with a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness similar to a common cold. Coronavirus symptoms include a runny nose cough sore throat possibly a headache and maybe a fever which can last for a couple of days.

For those with a weakened immune system the elderly and the very young theres a chance the virus could cause a lower and much more serious respiratory tract illness like a pneumonia or bronchitis.

There are a handful of human coronaviruses that are known to be deadly...

Coronavirus treatment

There is no specific treatment. Most of the time symptoms will go away on their own.

Doctors can relieve symptoms by prescribing a pain or fever medication. The CDC says a room humidifier or a hot shower can help with a sore throat or cough.

Drink plenty of fluids get rest and sleep as much as possible.

If symptoms feel worse than a standard cold see your doctor.

How can you can prevent it

There is no vaccine to protect against this family of viruses at least not yet... You may be able to reduce your risk of infection by avoiding people who are sick. Try to avoid touching your eyes nose and mouth. Wash your hands often with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds.

If you are sick stay home and avoid crowds and contact with others.

Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and disinfect the objects and surfaces you touch.” Source: cnn

January 22 2020 by Mike Adams editor Natural News
The next wave of attack against humanity has just been unleashed. The so-called novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is now spreading across Mainland China and with the Chinese New Year travel surge under way Chinas residents are exporting the virus everywhere. Confirmed cases have cropped up in Taiwan and the CDC has confirmed that at least one patient in the United States has been infected and hospitalized (after being misdiagnosed for a week during which he most likely spread the infections to others).
NOTE: Natural News is currently functioning in emergency mode after suffering a severe cyber attack that has temporarily disconnected us from our own data servers. Site functionality is very limited until we restore full connectivity. Thank you for your prayers as we navigate this latest malicious attempt to silence our journalism.
As covered by Alt Market:
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday confirmed the first U.S. case of a new coronavirus that has killed six people in China.
The CDC and Washington state officials said the man in his 30s was in good condition at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett. The symptoms presented Sunday and the diagnosis was confirmed Monday.
Nancy Messonnier director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases called the news concerning particularly in light of reports that the virus has begun to spread from person to person.
The confirmation of human-to-human spread in Asia certainly increases our concern Messonnier said.
The CDC which began enhanced health screenings last week at airports in San Francisco New York and Los Angeles said Atlanta and Chicago would be added to the list. All traveling from Wuhan China – where the outbreak began – to the USA are rerouted to these airports.
Cases have been found spreading to Japan South Korea Thailand Taiwan the Philippines Australia and now the United States reports DC Clothesline.
Already in Mexico?
One case of coronavirus which has been confirmed in Mexico involves a 57-year-old Asian man whose stops included Tijuana Beijing and Wuhan where the outbreak is known to be spreading. According to Breitbart News According to a statement from the Tamaulipas Health Secretariat a level three health protocol was triggered after a college professor was identified as a possible carrier of Coronavirus.
This is serious business warned Dr. Peter Hotez Dean of the Molecular Virology and Microbiology Department at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston in a Breitbart interview. We are now seeing person-to-person spreading of the virus.
Hotez recommends that everyone get a flu vaccine by the way even though this years flu vaccine has nothing whatsoever to do with the coronavirus thats spreading in China.
Upwards of 20000 people already infected in China according to estimates
Chinese health authorities announced Wednesday that 440 confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) had been reported in 13 provincial-level regions in the country by the end of Tuesday reports The Big Wobble. According to Prof Neil Fergusons table (see below) of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London 440 confirmed cases is the equivalent of almost 20000 unconfirmed cases.
The Big Wobble goes on to explain Published 5 days ago 45 confirmed cases was the equivalent of up to 2000 cases Today 440 confirmed cases is therefore the equivalent of almost 20000 unconfirmed cases according to Prof Neil Ferguson.
The conclusion of Prof. Fergusons analysis:
It is likely that the Wuhan outbreak of a novel coronavirus has caused substantially more cases of moderate or severe respiratory illness than currently reported.
Dave Hodges has also posted more details about patient zero in the United States.
A bioengineered weaponized viral strain
What seems obvious from the rapid adaption of this viral strain -- which has now achieved human-to-human transmission -- is that it has been engineered as a self-replicating weapon system to achieve the globalists depopulation goals.
The long incubation period that seems to be presently observed allows this viral strain to spread in stealth mode largely undetected until its payload fully activates. The longer the incubation period the more people are infected and become silent carriers (who may not even know they are infected).
Currently this coronavirus is believed to have a low fatality rate something less than 5%. However this may change as the viral strain adapts or is altered through transgenic effects emerging from exposure to other circulating viral strains. In other words viral strains can in certain cases recombine their proteins to create whole new strains. All this virus needs is to encounter a more deadly payl

Those preparations will continue regardless of whether or not the World Health Organization declares the outbreak spreading in and beyond China a global health emergency on Thursday. The agency was expected to  make a decision on Wednesday but delayed citing lack of information.

China remains the epicentre of the outbreak with more than 500 cases. Thailand the United States Taiwan South Korea and Japan have also confirmed cases.

The head of the WHOs health emergencies program Mike Ryan said the priority now is to find out how the virus is passing between people and to limit it.

We are in agreement with Chinese authorities who have been clear and transparent that there is evidence of human-to-human transmission he said.

Given the speed of global travel Canadian officials have said they would not be surprised if the virus lands here. If so airport screening would offer one measure in efforts to control the spread. But passengers arriving here may not show any symptoms for days which is why hospitals and health-care officials are getting ready.

Standard infection control practices like isolating potentially sick patients are key experts say.

At Toronto General Hospitals emergency department staff have already had some practice in the form of three patients who tested negative.

Weve had three patients come in with a travel history who presented with these symptoms said nurse Debra Davies the manager of the emergency department. Theyve done a phenomenal job in getting those patients into the isolation.

As long as we keep an eye on it we should be well prepared she said.

Davies is a veteran of the SARS outbreak in 2002-03 that infected more than 400 people in Canada and killed 44.

Dr. Michael Gardam chief of staff at Humber River Hospital in northwest Toronto says there were lessons learned from SARS.

I cant stress enough how incredibly unprepared we were for SARS he said. Were in such a better position now.

During that outbreak Gardam recalls running around trying to buy respirators and setting up negative pressure rooms to isolate patients. When Humber River opened in 2015 it was designed with outbreaks and infection control in mind and such equipment and design principles are built into the new hospital.

Horacio Arruda head of Quebecs public health authority said Wednesday five people in that province were under surveillance for possible exposure. 

Hospitals in Nova Scotia Saskatchewan Alberta and British Columbia have also announced preparations for cases. 

Airport screening

The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) acts as the lead agency for dealing with the coronavirus through the Quarantine Act.

Under PHACs direction Canada Border Services Agency officials will now ask travellers: Have you been in Wuhan China in the past 14 days? There are no direct flights from Wuhan to Canada.

Additional signs at airports in Toronto Montreal and Vancouver will remind passengers to speak to border officials if they have flu-like symptoms such as fever and cough.

We are in the process of putting up signs on the electronic screens warning travellers that if theyve been to an affected area to essentially determine if theyve been in contact with live animals sick people Dr. Theresa Tam Canadas chief public health officer said Tuesday on CBCs Power & Politics.

If so CBSA agents can alert a federal quarantine officer to do an assessment which could include a temperature check.

Canadas National Microbiology Laboratory as well as provincial government labs in Ontario British Columbia and Alberta have a battery of tests to detect respiratory pathogens including one thats in the works for the new coronavirus Allen said.  

So far Canada is not planning to use thermal imaging to monitor travellers en masse as was tested during the SARS outbreak.

Small percentage

Tam said the current assessment of the risk to Canada is low.

Steven Hoffman a law professor and director of the Global Strategy Lab at Torontos York University and an expert on global health supports Canadas screening approach so far.

Not everyone who has a high temperature is going to have this novel coronavirus. In fact only a very small percentage would said Hoffman.

The first U.S. patient illustrates one of the weaknesses of airport screening — the man in his 30s did not have symptoms when he arrived and was in good condition so he wouldnt be picked up in a check for fever.

Rather when the man started feeling ill he went to a doctor with a fever and cough. Lab tests confirmed the infection and he was put into isolation for monitoring.

Vancouver Coastal Health Medical Health Officers are monitoring reports of the novel coronavirus (named 2019-nCoV) first identified in Wuhan China. While there have been cases identified outside of China all of these individuals are known to have recently travelled to the Wuhan area.
 
Currently there are no reports of cases in Canada. Public Health officials are working together to ensure that any unusual illness in arriving travellers is being appropriately screened. Physicians have also been requested to notify Public Health of any illness of concern in patients who were recently in the Wuhan area.
 
The Vancouver School District has been advised that the risk to the general public including school-age children is very low. Medical Health Officers continue to monitor the situation closely and will provide further advice and information as it becomes available.
 
At this time reports indicate that similar to influenza this virus is spread when a sick person coughs or sneezes. Most of the reported cases are only showing mild symptoms and are well enough to stay home. As with influenza elderly people and those with underlying health conditions are more likely to develop severe disease and require hospitalization.
 
In the meantime we would remind everyone to follow proper hygiene etiquette during the cold & flu season. This includes proper hand-washing with soap and water covering your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and staying home when you are sick.","125542810834890_2679638695425276","KILLARNEYSEC"

Markets have tumbled as investors worry that Chinese shoppers will stay home for the Lunar New Year holiday and beyond. Economists say the possible impact isn’t yet clear.

HONG KONG — The outbreak of a deadly disease in China has cast a pall over growth prospects for the world’s second largest economy raising fears about the global outlook if the mysterious coronavirus spreads or worsens.

Financial markets across Asia fell on Thursday led by sharp drop in stocks in China as investors pondered the potential impact of the coronavirus. The extent of its severity has become more clear over the past two days as Chinese officials reported a surge in cases and a near doubling in the number of deaths to 17.

On Thursday officials extended limits on movement in and out of Wuhan the epicenter of the outbreak to two nearby cities that millions more call home.

The uncertainty has put a palpable damper on Chinese life just before the Lunar New Year holiday — typically a time of travel shopping and gift-giving — which begins on Friday. Train stations and airports were subdued as travelers changed plans for the weeklong holiday and seven of the most anticipated film openings of the holiday season were postponed.
The Forbidden City — China’s most popular tourist attraction — announced without giving further information that it would be closed starting on Saturday.

On the minds of many in China and around the world right now: Could this new virus cause the same kind of damage as the SARS epidemic which killed 800 people in 2003?

The question is a crucial one beyond China because the Chinese economy has for years been one of the world’s most powerful growth engines. A stumble in China could hobble jobs and growth elsewhere.

China’s growth in 2003 plunged briefly during the height of SARS but came roaring back in a time when global companies were building Chinese factories and exporting more and more goods abroad.

Today China’s economy is bigger but is growing at its slowest pace in nearly three decades. It is grappling with problems like the trade war with the United States and a campaign to wean local governments and companies off their addiction to borrowing.
It also depends more on consumers like Mo Chen 29 who is curtailing her holiday travel plans to stay on the safe side. In 2003 the worst-hit sectors were transportation retail and restaurants.

Ms. Mo who works for an internet company in Shanghai had been looking forward to traveling home to see her family in Xiangyang Hubei Province nearly 200 miles from Wuhan. But given the outbreak she and her brother who lives in the city of Hangzhou decided not to go home. For Ms. Mo it will be the first time she has not spent Lunar New Year with her parents.

She now plans to stock up on supplies and stay home not even venturing out to meet friends or go to the movies. She also intends to skip a trip to the mall to buy new outfits because nobody will be around to see her wear them. Her brother meanwhile is planning to buy pots and pans.

“He never cooks” she said. “He always either eats out or eats at the company canteen. But last night our mom asked us to stock up on food not go out and cook at home.”

For now the impact is not yet clear. The authorities seem to be responding faster to this outbreak than they did in 2003 but China’s censors are erasing anything that veers from the official narrative. The new coronavirus appears to be less deadly than SARS but it is difficult to detect and the authorities’ limiting of movement out of Wuhan came only after many people had set out for their holiday travels.

“It’s going to depend on how China continues to be transparent with the international community” said Peter Levesque the managing director of Modern Terminals a port operator in Hong Kong. “That’s all business can ask for. The rest is unknown.”
Wuhan itself is essential to commerce in its region of China though the economic impact there is expected to be muted by the advent of the holiday. The city is a major national transport hub and has also become a key center for auto manufacturing with factories that build cars for General Motors Honda and many others as well as dozens of auto parts makers.

But the effect on people across the country could be a more important factor.

To be able to handles the viruses we need to in a way to make some conclusion what does this mean? Is that in the current form current condition viruses are very simple. (2:04:46)  

In a scientific way when we look at the solar system when we have sun and when we have transit system in the world of science understanding the field these fields are connected to each other in many ways. But they are connected thru’ the matching strengths to each other. Doesn’t matter in which way it could be.   

So what they tell us very clearly these are energy packs which are created by emotion coming from the emotion of the animal. And interesting enough we transfer thru’ our lung systems thru’ our breathing which are the emotional part of the human body. We don’t see these viruses are attached or attack muscles tissues or whatever else.   

?Who will get viruses?? 

In so many ways in the present system it’s very easy to understand how these viruses can be handled. And in a very simple way we can deplete them from it. As they say these viruses take holes and move in within the structure of themselves we who sit on the amino acids becomes delivering energy which is not needed and energy which needs to be consumed till the point of this specific condition.   

And this is very in line with some people catches the viruses and some people don’t. which means those who caught these viruses they all have to have specific strength of common denominator energy level. We can come in touch with it if the amino acids are in the lungs it’s not of this strength matching of the virus we don’t catch. which means go back to what we said this specific strength matching lost to amino acids and this create this condition. And many people have that strength and when the strength of the emotion of the animal matches this strength of emotion of the man the virus transfer it.   

This is a vitally important position. When man travels into space in the space we will become homesick will get viruses attach to our emotion of missing home. You will get all sorts of these energy packs to our structure. And in the space condition we need to understand more. This will be lot of research in the future to come in this level of understanding. (2:08:37)  

?How can we help and understand to help? if you have lungs which get infected by this material by this energy it has to go to passage or to the breathing now so these are the air-amino acids connected disease for what we call energy packs.   

?the example of the Cup of life?  

The most fundamental point for people in China is cover their faces with the common face masks at the same time we see fever or the pneumonia the proper source proper way to transfer the energy of the viruses out of it is to introduce another plasma into it a gans state because it’s energy pack. (2:10:00)  

You remember the water with an orange banana when you create and put the material around the cup you manage to transfer the energy of the orange or the banana to the cup. We create the condition of the energy field that it could be transferred.   

Many of you when you make this cup you said you don’t taste or feel anything. Because there is one vital element the copy was too clean there is no amino acid to create the condition of the transfer.   

So what we learnt from this for the knowledge seekers to go out to eliminate this  is the existence the presence of amino acids gans we used you create the condition that amino acid or the field which is connected to the virus via the passage of transfer you will find very rapidly the virus depletes itself fever pneumonia lung infection would change the condition of body of the man.   

what gans to be used?

So one of the fundamental thing you have is use of the amino acids on your gans system that you can create that link.   The other point is as the existed emotional there is a clear direction is connected amino acid to the zinc as it connects itself to the muscles or environmental muscle tissue of the lung is the presence and application of copper.   

You got to remember the energy of the virus is more. So the total affect the gans of amino acids has to be weaker that the virus that you can deplete the energy into it. Part of the energy of the virus itself part of the energy of the virus in that amino acids but none has the strength to carry on and we see rapid reduction in temperature of fever and cleaning the lungs. (2:13:07)  

The way we suggest to our Chinese colleagues is very simple. You use these masks to breathe. Make mixture of amino acids of the Zinc plus Cu (copper) and frequently spray above it(?). Either way as you breathe you create the lungs at the same time you deplete if there is any more virus link connection to your amino acid.   

In a way you put a barrier between the one who carries it and your

Firstly there are no current reports of confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection in Richmond Hill nor Ontario nor even Canada at large. The health and wellbeing of the people of Ontario is our government’s top concern. The Government of Canada and provinces and territories have multiple systems in place to identify prevent and control the spread of serious infectious diseases into and within Canada. One of those governmental systems The Public Health Agency of Canada is reporting that the risk of disease importation of the novel coronavirus and spreading internationally including to Canada is considered low. That being said to strengthen Ontario’s ability to monitor any coronavirus cases our Government is adding novel coronavirus as a designated disease reportable under Ontario’s public health legislation. Therefore physicians hospitals and other health care facilities will be required to report a suspected or confirmed case of the new coronavirus to their local medical officer of health.Consequently the local public health unit can then quickly and effectively take all necessary measures to investigate get appropriate lab tests done and do case and contact management to prevent and control further spread of the infection.
 Ontario’s health system today is far more prepared to respond to any potential infections than in the past .For routine respiratory outbreaks in institutions and public hospitals the Ministry of Health (MOH) has guidance for long-term care homes to minimize transmission of respiratory infections. Specifically related to the current situation in China the MOH monitors for potential cases of novel coronavirus with travel history to Wuhan China is ready to coordinate provincial actions and respond should an individual associated with this new novel coronavirus be identified in Ontario and continues to monitor the situation with Public Health Ontario and public health officials to determine whether any further action is needed. Speaking of finally please note that as this is a public health concern this issue falls under the purview of the Ministry of Health. Questions about the outbreak should be directed to MOH’s MO.","100028955647744_257381791903674","daisy.wai.104"

The virus that has infected hundreds in China shows signs of being far worse than SARS the pandemic that killed nearly 800 people 17 years ago a prominent virologist has warned after travelling to Wuhan where the new coronavirus first began to spread.

Yi Guan who played an important role in tracing the development of SARS spoke hours before authorities prepared to place a second Chinese city on lockdown as local officials employ increasingly harsh measures in hopes of controlling the spread of the deadly Wuhan virus. Beginning at midnight Thursday all public transport will halt in Huanggang and checks mandated for every person entering or exiting the city of 7.5 million situated 70 kilometres east of Wuhan. All theatres cafes and entertainment venues will be closed as well. Authorities said they would also close rail stations in nearby Ezhou a city of one million.

“Conservative estimates suggest that the scale of infection may eventually be 10 times higher than SARS” said Dr. Guan director of the State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases at the University of Hong Kong told China’s Caixin media group on Thursday. Dr. Guan spent two days in Wuhan this week.

The World Health Organization said it would deliberate again on Thursday whether it should declare a global emergency around the 2019-nCoV virus which causes pneumonia-like symptoms and is believed to have originated at a market that sold wild game.

Ivan Hung chief of the infectious diseases division at the University of Hong Kong said the ability to rapidly identify the virus in patients should help authorities to counteract its spread. And he said “so far the virus is behaving in a less lethal manner than the SARS.”

Dr. Guan however left Wuhan convinced that “the epidemic situation was out of control.”

Most viral outbreaks ”are controllable” he said. He pointed to SARS H5N1 and swine fever.

“I’ve experienced so much and Ive never felt scared before” he said. “But this time Im scared.”

By Thursday evening Chinese authorities had identified 634 confirmed cases 422 suspected cases and 17 deaths in 30 provinces and regions including Hong Kong and Macau. Singapore on Thursday confirmed its first case: a 66-year old man from Wuhan. Further cases have been confirmed in Taiwan Thailand South Korea Japan and the U.S.

The comments from Dr. Guan mark the strongest warning to emerge from a professional who has travelled to Wuhan a city of 11 million that on Thursday entered a partial lockdown. At 10 a.m. authorities shut down the city’s public transit and barred the boarding of outbound trains and planes.

Local officials described taking “war-time measures” state media reported. That included the return of China’s familiar heavy-handed control of information: Censors quickly deleted a post from the Wuhan Health Commission admitting to “long queues and a shortage of beds in fever clinics.” The commission has been an important source of local updates. Numerous people in Wuhan took to social media to say they were unable to get medical treatment — or refused diagnostic tests calling into question the thoroughness of official statistics even as the scale of the lockdown pointed to significant concern.

But the draconian measures being undertaken may be too late Dr. Guan said pointing to the great numbers of people who had already left Wuhan to return to childhood homes across China before the lockdown was imposed.

“When these people returned to their hometowns they took the virus to all parts of the country” he said. In Wuhan doctors told Caixin that the number of people infected could reach as high as 6000. Using computer modelling researchers at Imperial College London now estimate as many as 4000 cases could exist in Wuhan alone.

Given the incubation period of the virus Dr. Guan estimated that pneumonia-like symptoms may begin to appear more broadly across China beginning Jan. 25. It called into question whether the nation-wide public rush to wear masks — few faces remained uncovered at airports and train stations across the country Thursday — had also come too late.

Other experts disagreed. “We have got the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus and the ability to perform rapid diagnosis” said Dr. Hung at the University of Hong Kong. “During SARS we were playing catchup and had no knowledge of the SARS coronavirus until very late stage — likely five to six months after the outbreak.”

At the Beijing West Train Station a porter on Thursday told passersby that bullet trains passing through Wuhan were being disinfected several times a day. Chinese social media called attention to accounts this week from people encountering frontline workers at state-owned firms who had been told not to wear masks lest it add to the sense of seri

By Yawen Chen and Se Young Lee

BEIJING (Reuters) – China put on lockdown on Thursday two cities at the epicentre of a new coronavirus outbreak that has killed 17 people and infected nearly 600 as health authorities around the world scramble to prevent a global pandemic.

Health officials fear the transmission rate will accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home and abroad during week-long holidays for the Lunar New Year which begins on Saturday.

The previously unknown virus strain is believed to have emerged late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

Most transport in Wuhan a city of 11 million people was suspended on Thursday morning and people were told not to leave. Hours later state media in neighbouring Huanggang a city of some 6 million people said it was imposing a similar lockdown.

Chinese authorities gave no new details on the numbers of virus infections but it has been reported in Beijing Shanghai and Hong Kong and several other countries including the United States stoking fears it is already spreading worldwide.

Wuhan’s city government said it would shut down all urban transport networks and suspend outgoing flights from 10 a.m. (0200 GMT). Domestic media said some airlines were operating after the deadline however.

State media broadcast images of one of Wuhan’s transport hubs the Hankou rail station nearly deserted with gates blocked or barred. The government is urging citizens not to leave the city.

State media reported highway toll booths around Wuhan were closing down which would effectively cut off road exits. Guards were patrolling major highways one resident told Reuters.

As the city slipped into isolation residents thronged into hospitals for checks and scrambled for supplies clearing out supermarket shelves and queuing for petrol.

Authorities in Huanggang ordered indoor entertainment venues including cinemas and internet cafes to close and were asking citizens not to leave other than under special circumstances state media said.

Authorities had confirmed 571 cases and 17 deaths by the end of Wednesday China‘s National Health Commission said. Earlier it said another 393 suspected cases had been reported.

Of eight known cases worldwide Thailand has confirmed four while Japan South Korea Taiwan and the United States have reported one each.

In a report on Wednesday Imperial College London said it estimated a total of 4000 cases of the coronavirus in Wuhan alone as of Jan. 18 an infection rate based on the number of cases reported in China and elsewhere.

“We stressed to them that by having a strong action not only they will control the outbreak in their country but they will also minimise the chances of this outbreak spreading internationally. So they recognise that” he said.

Despite China‘s response stock markets across Asia were on the back foot on Thursday led by drops of roughly 1.5% in Hong Kong and Shanghai while China‘s yuan fell to a two-week low.

FLIGHTS RAIL SUSPENDED

There is no vaccine for the virus which can spread through respiratory transmission. Symptoms include fever difficulty in breathing and cough similar to many other respiratory illnesses.

Preliminary research suggested the virus was passed on to humans from snakes but government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan has also identified badgers and rats as possible sources. Confirmed sufferers include 15 medical workers.

Technology giant Amazon is working to allow customers to connect their credit card information to their hands so that they can scan for purchases with their palms at checkout areas in physical stores people familiar with the project told The Wall Street Journal.

While Amazons plan is in the early stages the company has reportedly begun working with Visa on testing out the terminals and has discussed the project with Mastercard JPMorgan Chase Wells Fargo and Synchrony Financial.

The company previously filed a patent for a non-contact biometric identification system that features a hand scanner to produce a picture of a persons palm.

The news offers a look into Amazons ideas on transforming the way people shop in brick-and-mortar stores and how it could work with credit card companies to further integrate itself into peoples financial lives.

The company already has major plans to expand its Amazon Go stores which allow shoppers to buy without cashiers or checkout as well as its voice payment service called Amazon Pay.

Amazon will have to address concerns from card issuers and customers over how terminals would detect fraud and the amount of personal information the company will receive from the scans.

Data collected from the terminals would be stored on Amazons cloud and used to study consumers Amazon.com spending habits according to The Journal.

An Amazon spokesperson declined CNBCs request to comment.

MarketWatch.com – Top Stories

Investors are facing a new worry on their return from a long weekend: the potential that China’s coronavirus will spread massively during a big upcoming national holiday.

“The worry is this is another SARS an outbreak that saw thousands infected and led to hundreds of deaths. It also led to billions of dollars of losses and hit Chinese GDP growth by up to 1 percentage point” said Neil Wilson chief market analyst at trading platform Markets.com.

A repeat of that would mean the International Monetary Fund’s latest and less-optimistic forecasts not standing up and a sharp contraction for many leading indicators of the global economy he told clients. While it’s probably too soon to panic a pandemic scare may be an excuse for some investors to cash in on a bullish start to the year — the S&P 500 managed its sixth record close of 2020 on Friday.

That leads us to our call of the day from Saxo Bank’s head of equity strategy Peter Garnry who is flashing a short-term warning about a stock selloff especially for technology names which have led 2019’s gains.

“The acceleration that we have seen seems quite similar to what we saw in January 2018” Garnry told MarketWatch in an interview. During that month the S&P climbed 5.6% then dropped 3.9% and 2.7% in February and March 2018 respectively.

Mimicking similar moves in the run-up to that selloff he notes “epic short squeeze” in shares of electric-car maker Tesla              TSLA -0.58%           for example. That refers to a stock spiking because bearish investors who sold borrowed shares as they bet on a fall have to buy them back at higher prices.

And then he sees the FANG (Facebook              FB 0.17%           Amazon              AMZN -0.70%           Netflix              NFLX 0.31%            and Alphabet-parent Google              GOOGL 2.02%           )  Index              NYFANG 0.41%            “accelerating at an unprecedented pace showing clear signs of frothy behavior.” Note Netflix reports after the close.

As well as this investors aren’t buying much downside protection for stocks Garnry said. But on the bright side he said when this selloff gets out of the way equities will probably keep marching higher.

The market

Dow              YM00 -0.23%           S&P              ES00 -0.34%            and Nasdaq              NQ00 -0.43%            futures are in the red while European luxury stocks              SXXP -0.53%           got blasted over coronavirus worries. Naturally China              SHCOMP -1.41%            and Hong Kong              HSI -2.81%            stocks were hit hard. A Moody’s downgrade for Hong Kong didn’t help. 

The chart

Anxieties around a SARS-like viral outbreak are running high as the death toll reaches six with nearly 300 infected and a Chinese official confirmed human-to-human transmission. Fears that the coronavirus virus may spread quickly come as China’s Lunar New Year which involves mass traveling is due to kick off on Saturday.

Our chart shows stocks in the firing line on Tuesday — China Eastern Airlines              CEA -1.04%           China Southern Airlines              ZNH -0.20%           airline Cathay Pacific              293 -4.07%            and casino operator Wynn Macau              1128 -4.81%           to name a few.

Swiss banking group UBS              UBS -0.45%            UBSG -5.08%            cut guidance after disappointing results with its shares sliding.

The quote

“The American dream is back bigger better and stronger than ever before.” — That was U.S. President Donald Trump speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Alongside plenty of billionaires and chief executives was teen climate activist Greta Thunberg who said global leaders have been all talk no action.

January 22 2020 by Mike Adams editor Natural News
The next wave of attack against humanity has just been unleashed. The so-called novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is now spreading across Mainland China and with the Chinese New Year travel surge under way Chinas residents are exporting the virus everywhere. Confirmed cases have cropped up in Taiwan and the CDC has confirmed that at least one patient in the United States has been infected and hospitalized (after being misdiagnosed for a week during which he most likely spread the infections to others).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday confirmed the first U.S. case of a new coronavirus that has killed six people in China.
The CDC and Washington state officials said the man in his 30s was in good condition at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett. The symptoms presented Sunday and the diagnosis was confirmed Monday.
Nancy Messonnier director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases called the news concerning particularly in light of reports that the virus has begun to spread from person to person.
The confirmation of human-to-human spread in Asia certainly increases our concern Messonnier said.
The CDC which began enhanced health screenings last week at airports in San Francisco New York and Los Angeles said Atlanta and Chicago would be added to the list. All traveling from Wuhan China – where the outbreak began – to the USA are rerouted to these airports.
Cases have been found spreading to Japan South Korea Thailand Taiwan the Philippines Australia and now the United States reports DC Clothesline.

Already in Mexico?
One case of coronavirus which has been confirmed in Mexico involves a 57-year-old Asian man whose stops included Tijuana Beijing and Wuhan where the outbreak is known to be spreading. According to Breitbart News According to a statement from the Tamaulipas Health Secretariat a level three health protocol was triggered after a college professor was identified as a possible carrier of Coronavirus.
This is serious business warned Dr. Peter Hotez Dean of the Molecular Virology and Microbiology Department at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston in a Breitbart interview. We are now seeing person-to-person spreading of the virus.
Hotez recommends that everyone get a flu vaccine by the way even though this years flu vaccine has nothing whatsoever to do with the coronavirus thats spreading in China.

Upwards of 20000 people already infected in China according to estimates
Chinese health authorities announced Wednesday that 440 confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) had been reported in 13 provincial-level regions in the country by the end of Tuesday reports The Big Wobble. According to Prof Neil Fergusons table (see below) of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London 440 confirmed cases is the equivalent of almost 20000 unconfirmed cases.
The Big Wobble goes on to explain Published 5 days ago 45 confirmed cases was the equivalent of up to 2000 cases Today 440 confirmed cases is therefore the equivalent of almost 20000 unconfirmed cases according to Prof Neil Ferguson.
The conclusion of Prof. Fergusons analysis:
It is likely that the Wuhan outbreak of a novel coronavirus has caused substantially more cases of moderate or severe respiratory illness than currently reported.
Dave Hodges has also posted more details about patient zero in the United States.

A bioengineered weaponized viral strain
What seems obvious from the rapid adaption of this viral strain -- which has now achieved human-to-human transmission -- is that it has been engineered as a self-replicating weapon system to achieve the globalists depopulation goals.
The long incubation period that seems to be presently observed allows this viral strain to spread in stealth mode largely undetected until its payload fully activates. The longer the incubation period the more people are infected and become silent carriers (who may not even know they are infected).
Currently this coronavirus is believed to have a low fatality rate something less than 5%. However this may change as the viral strain adapts or is altered through transgenic effects emerging from exposure to other circulating viral strains. In other words viral strains can in certain cases recombine their proteins to create whole new strains. All this virus needs is to encounter a more deadly payload and incorporate that genetic sequence into its own.
The bottom line? Humanity is now under serious threat from these engineered bioweapons. They are fully resistant to known antibiotics making them superbugs for which there is no known conventional treatment. This will inevitably cause many people to turn to colloidal silver chlorine dioxide esse

Experts said the stunning scale of the shutdown isolating a major urban transit hub larger than New York City was without precedent.

“It’s an unbelievable undertaking” said Dr. Howard Markel a professor of the history of medicine at the University of Michigan adding that he had never heard of so many people being cordoned off as a disease-prevention measure.

Still “people are going to get out” he said. “It’s going to be leaky.”

By limiting the movements of millions of people in an attempt to protect public health China is engaging in a balancing act with a long and complicated history fraught with social political and ethical concerns.

James G. Hodge Jr. director of the Center for Public Health Law and Policy at Arizona State University said the shutdown would almost certainly lead to human rights violations and would be patently unconstitutional in the United States.

“It could very easily backfire” he said adding that the restrictions could prevent healthy people from fleeing the city perhaps exposing them to greater risk of infection. “In general this is risky business.”

To combat the spread of the virus which first appeared at the end of December and has killed at least 17 people and sickened more than 500 the Chinese government said it would cancel planes and trains leaving Wuhan beginning Thursday and suspend buses subways and ferries within it.

The practice of isolating people and goods to halt the spread of disease dates at least to the 14th century when ships arriving in Venice during the plague epidemic were required to anchor off the coast for 40 days. The isolation period gave rise to the term quarantine from the Italian quaranta giorni meaning 40 days according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Professor Hodge said quarantines could be effective if they selectively isolate only those who have been infected or are suspected of infection. The response in Wuhan with the establishment of a “cordon sanitaire”-type boundary goes much further than that.

“Quarantine would be saying ‘You can’t leave your own home can’t go to school work or church’” he said. But the Chinese authorities “have drawn a line around this city and said ‘No one in and no one out.’ That type of thing is obviously an excessive response.”

In recent years governments have imposed other large-scale measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.

Sierra Leone a country of about seven million people said “everybody” was expected to stay indoors for three days in September 2014 as 7000 teams of health and community workers went door to door to find hidden Ebola patients.

Earlier that year Liberian officials placed West Point a sprawling slum in Monrovia where 60000 to 120000 people were crammed into shacks under an Ebola quarantine. The order led to deadly clashes with soldiers and may have helped to spread the disease experts said forcing people to crowd together for basic humanitarian aid.

During the SARS outbreak of 2003 Canadian health officials asked anyone in Ontario who had even one symptom of the respiratory infection to stay home for a few days out of fear that the disease might spread during the Easter holiday weekend.

In Beijing at least 4000 residents who had been exposed to the virus were kept in isolation and 300 college students who had had contact with infected people were sequestered in a military camp for two weeks.

Historians have noted that quarantines have often targeted marginalized populations.

During the plague epidemic of the 14th century European city-states posted armed guards on roads and access points to keep out merchants people with leprosy and minority groups such as Jews according to Eugenia Tognotti a researcher in Italy who has written on the history of quarantine.

And during a wave of cholera outbreaks in Europe in the 1830s Naples restricted the movement of prostitutes and beggars who were thought to be carriers of the contagion she wrote.

Russian Jews brought typhus fever into the Lower East Side of Manhattan in 1892 Dr. Markel said. It was not only infected people who were rounded up and quarantined on an island off the Bronx however but also their neighbors and others whom they had simply greeted on the street.

“That’s the darker side of quarantine — its misuse as a social tool rather than its scientific use as a medical tool” Dr. Markel said.

Ionic colloidal silver  25ppm 1mlday is the dose I take when flue like symptoms appear

What is Colloidal Silver?
Colloidal Silver is simply solid particles of silver 1 nm to 1000 nm in size suspended in distilled water. The largest allowed colloidal particle of 1000 nm would contain about 45000000000 atoms or ions of silver.

Colloidal Silver has multiple forms. We will focus on the two main forms of Ionic Silver and Colloidal Silver.

Ionic silver is defined as a concentration of silver ions suspended in highly purified water where the majority of the solution is comprised of positively charged silver atoms. When a silver atom loses one or more of its electrons it is now termed an ion of silver and carries a positive charge because the protons of its structure now outnumber the electrons. Protons are positively charged while electrons are negatively charged. A greater amount of positive elements shifts the charge of the atom (ion) to positive. Ionic silver is denoted in physics and chemistry as (Ag).

Colloidal silver is defined as a concentration of silver particles 1 nm to 1000 nm in size suspended in highly purified water where the majority of the solution is non-ionic pure silver metal where there are no other additives.

Most of the products sold as Colloidal Silver are in essence mostly Ionic Silver NOT true Colloidal Silver due to the high cost and degree of manufacturing complexity.

True colloidal silver is mostly (50 – 80%) silver particles the rest being ionic silver.

The Ionic Silver VS Colloidal Silver Debate
Ionic Silver – Pathogenic organisms have a net negative charge. A negatively charged pathogen will attract a positively charged silver ion. Thus the theory goes that silver ions have a more powerful germicidal effect than non-ionic silver atoms. While this sounds straightforward there is one major flaw in this theory which is the delivery mechanism. In order for the ionic silver to get to the bloodstream it needs to get past the stomach acid first. Ionic silver becomes worthless as soon as it is swallowed because the silver ions immediately combine with chloride ions to form silver chloride. Silver chloride has no antibacterial properties and is a useless waste product which the body expels. Having said that Ionic Silver seems to be superior as a topical or external solution. Colloidal Silver particles are more effective for internal use as they remain unaffected by stomach acid.

Colloidal Silver - The physical presence of colloidal silver particles near a virus fungus bacterium or any other single-celled pathogen disables its oxygen metabolism enzyme. This process suffocates and kills the pathogen. The pathogen is then cleared out of the body. The colloidal silver is then set free again to continue the attack on other pathogens. This creates a strong multiplier effect increasing the effectiveness and impact.

The zeta potential charge keeps the particles uniformly distributed in the colloid and from clumping together. The higher the zeta potential the less clumping there is.

The key to effective colloidal silver is to have the smallest particle size possible and to have the highest concentration of particles. The smaller the particles the deeper they are able to penetrate. The more particles there are the more impact they will make.

Antibiotics VS Colloidal Silver
antibiotics ionic colloidal silver
Antibiotics kill only 5-6 types of germs. Extensive use of antibiotics has spawned new antibiotic resistant strains called Super Bugs for which antibiotics have no effect. Use of Colloidal Silver does not cause new strains to develop. Colloidal Silver is highly effective on Super Bugs.
100000 to 300000 reactions a year of which 30% to 50% are fatal. No recorded detrimental effects.
Highly effective for specific bacterial diseases only. Some are effective for most bacteria. Has no effect on fungi or viruses. Highly effective in fungal bacterial and viral infections.
Zero impact on healing Accelerates healing
Zero impact on reducing scarring Reduces scarring
Dosage must be carefully monitored No known overdose of properly made Colloidal Silver

Apparently they got the news from various (hyped) media outlets. Just to be clear as of January 23 (10:42 AM): There is NO CONFIRMED 2019-nCoV CASE in KALIBO. 

Based on what I picked up from the local news (i.e. not personal info) 3 suspected cases (exhibiting flu-like symptoms? ) were referred to our provincial hospital (DRSTMH) for further check-up andscreening in the past three days. Two of these are Chinese nationals (not sure if from Wuhan) and one is a flight attendant with a travel history to Wuhan (but stayed in the plane the whole time she was there). All three suspected cases were ‘cleared’ (upon checking for additional signs and symptoms) and eventually released. Throat swabs were taken and sent to Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) for initial molecular diagnostics. As far as I understand the current protocol in place is that RITM performs RT-PCR for the presence of coronaviruses (using conserved primers for all coronaviruses but not specific to nCoV). Positive samples will then be sent to another lab in Australia for nCoV confirmatory testing. This protocol may change soon though (fingers crossed!) – as soon as RITMDOH have nCov-specific primers. But for now we have the capability of ruling out suspected cases based on whether or not they turn out positive for ‘general coronavirus’ RT-PCR (pancoronavirus non-specific assay). Keri na yun as an initial screening (better than nothing) :) 

Based on the news there is a 5-yr old boy from Wuhan City who tested positive for the assay (https:www.cnnphilippines.comnews2020121coronavirus-china-tourists-aklan-.html) but it remains an unidentified coronavirus upon further confirmation. One information that I believe should be emphasized here so as not to cause panic is that the boy is now stable and afebrile. We are used to watching all these virus outbreaks movies wherein people contract the pathogen and die (unless op kors da bida got infected so syempre someone will miraculously find a cure). The current CoV situation is not as dire as that…yet. So far mortality rate is 2% (https:www.scientificamerican.comarticleinfectious-disease-expert-discusses-what-we-know-about-the-new-chinese-virus).  This does not mean we should be heedless though. On the contrary. Proper authorities should be extra vigilant. Effective biosecurity measures and quarantine protocols should be in place.

We should be concerned about this virus because it is novel. Meaning human immune system has not been exposed to this strain of coronavirus yet. And therefore we (likely) cannot mount an effective protective response against it (I am not updated with the status of SARS vaccine development but has any of the candidate vaccines been through clinical trials? And I wonder if it is cross-protective against nCoV given there is significant difference daw sequence-wise…not sure structure-wise). Also there is not much known about this novel coronavirus strain. Are there specific manifestations that medical practitioners can use to tell them apart from signs and symptoms of other respiratory infections?  Since there are no vaccines available are there effective antivirals against it? How easily can it spread (human-to-human transmission)? Respiratory route (via droplets) was assumed because it is a respiratory illness but there may be additional unknown routes for spreading the virus. Sidenote: nCoV likely emerged from an initial zoonotic (animal to human) infection. But I heard someone mentioned that it probably came from seafood. Not likely. It is believed that Patient Zero got it from a seafood market in Wuhan City. But this specific seafood market sells other animal meats too. So the host jump is likely from some warm-blooded animal (bats cats monkey pigs etc) to humans. Kasi kung from coldblooded animal to human ang pag-cross ng species barrier naku super major finding yan! Extra-extra sidenote: The main reason I have been using fish as a model system for studying dynamics of virus infection transmission and virulence (even though my academic background is in mammals) is because I want the advantage of studying a pathogen in its natural host without the risk of getting infected. Tas bigla me ganung host jump. Skeri! .     

But again the ‘good news’ (‘good’ being relative here) is that the current circulating strain is not that deadly (2% mortality). BUT viruses will always have the potential to mutate and evolve into something more virulent. All the more reason for us to do our best to control its spread. Hence the importance of biosecurity measures and efficient diagnosis. I believe Kalibo International Airport staff is doing their best to screen passengers (especially those from Wuhan-Kalibo direct flights). But they have limi

Weaponized coronavirus invades the USA as world panics over possible pandemic

The next wave of attack against humanity has just been unleashed. The so-called novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is now spreading across Mainland China and with the Chinese New Year travel surge under way Chinas residents are exporting the virus everywhere. Confirmed cases have cropped up in Taiwan and the CDC has confirmed that at least one patient in the United States has been infected and hospitalized (after being misdiagnosed for a week during which he most likely spread the infections to others).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday confirmed the first U.S. case of a new coronavirus that has killed six people in China. 
The CDC and Washington state officials said the man in his 30s was in good condition at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett. The symptoms presented Sunday and the diagnosis was confirmed Monday. 
Nancy Messonnier director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases called the news concerning particularly in light of reports that the virus has begun to spread from person to person. 
The confirmation of human-to-human spread in Asia certainly increases our concern Messonnier said. 
The CDC which began enhanced health screenings last week at airports in San Francisco New York and Los Angeles said Atlanta and Chicago would be added to the list. All traveling from Wuhan China – where the outbreak began – to the USA are rerouted to these airports. 
Cases have been found spreading to Japan South Korea Thailand Taiwan the Philippines Australia and now the United States reports DC Clothesline. 

Already in Mexico?
One case of coronavirus which has been confirmed in Mexico involves a 57-year-old Asian man whose stops included Tijuana Beijing and Wuhan where the outbreak is known to be spreading. According to Breitbart News According to a statement from the Tamaulipas Health Secretariat a level three health protocol was triggered after a college professor was identified as a possible carrier of Coronavirus. 
This is serious business warned Dr. Peter Hotez Dean of the Molecular Virology and Microbiology Department at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston in a Breitbart interview. We are now seeing person-to-person spreading of the virus. 
Hotez recommends that everyone get a flu vaccine by the way even though this years flu vaccine has nothing whatsoever to do with the coronavirus thats spreading in China. 

Upwards of 20000 people already infected in China according to estimates
Chinese health authorities announced Wednesday that 440 confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) had been reported in 13 provincial-level regions in the country by the end of Tuesday reports The Big Wobble. According to Prof Neil Fergusons table (see below) of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London 440 confirmed cases is the equivalent of almost 20000 unconfirmed cases.

Misplaced solicitousness
Philippine Daily Inquirer  04:08 AM January 21 2020

A sight familiar to Philippine Coast Guard personnel and Filipino fishermen docked at the Manila port last week: a China Coast Guard (CCG) ship with the tell-tale blue and red streaks painted on its white hull.

Ships like it are not a welcoming presence in the West Philippine Sea where they are often encountered as ABS-CBN’s Chiara Zambrano noted in her report they are the vessels that would drive away Philippine ships shoo Filipino fishermen (sometimes with water cannon) away from their traditional fishing grounds and blockade shoals that are well within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone — because the CCG upon Beijing’s orders insists that the waters are Chinese territory.

But there was CCG Vessel 5204 docking at the capital for what was billed as a “goodwill” or “friendly” visit — at the height of the national emergency caused by the Taal Volcano eruption which would displace hundreds of thousands of families and disrupt economic activity in one of the country’s most important economic hubs in the blink of an afternoon and leave the government scrambling to get official relief efforts going.

In Manila’s Port Area however the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) was busy rolling out the red carpet and giving formal arrival ceremonies for its Chinese counterpart complete with a large contingent of PCG personnel in their parade attire.

It turned out in the wake of public indignation over the government’s effusive welcome that it was the PCG that had invited the CCG to come for a week-long visit. What were they thinking?

PCG commandant Admiral Joel Garcia justified his bright idea of inviting the very enforcer of China’s militarization of and destructive illegal fishing in the South China Sea as an “opportunity” to air the Philippines’ grievances.

“Kung uunahin natin at aalalahanin parati yung ginawang masama sa ating mga mangingisda hindi na po uusad… Wala pong ibang solusyon kundi pumunta tayo sa isang lamesa mag-usap harap-harapan at sabihin natin ang ating hinaing (If we focus on the wrongs they have done against our fishermen we will not move forward… The only solution for us is to talk face to face and to tell them our grievances)” Garcia told reporters.

He added: “Mauunawaan ng taumbayan na kahit na alam natin na kung mananatili ?yung sama ng loob ng dalawang tao hindi nag-uusap tuluyan na magkaaway hindi po maganda sa pamilya (The people will understand that if hard feelings will remain between two people without talking the conflict will go on. It is not good for the family).”

What “family” is Garcia talking about? And why should the Philippines assume the obeisant mollifying pose when Beijing has never been apologetic for its bullying provocative actions in the West Philippine Sea?

In fact right on the week the CCG was being feted in Manila one of its ships was spotted anew reconnoitering around Ayungin Shoal (Second Thomas Shoal) some 200 kilometers (120 miles) from Palawan.

As Ryan Martinson an assistant professor at the US Naval War College’s Chinese Maritime Studies Institute noted in a tweet accompanied by a photo of the ship’s movement: “The Philippines rolls out the red carpet for the Commander of the China Coast Guard. Meanwhile a China Coast Guard ship steams back and forth menacing Philippine Marines posted at Second Thomas Shoal.”

Since Garcia’s stated lofty goal was to raise the issue of the harassment of Filipino fishermen during the CCG’s “goodwill visit” he has to be asked: Did the discussion actually happen and what was the result of it? What were the points agreed upon between the two parties?

If he fails to answer that then Garcia must be seen as having dissembled and talked out of both sides of his mouth. After all according to an official higher than him in the pecking order — Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana — the visit was “not the proper venue” to raise the issue.

It would be more appropriate said Lorenzana to iron this out during the discussions on the proposed Code of Conduct in the South China Sea. So if no substantive discussion happened what exactly was the visit for?

This is misplaced solicitousness at its worst — a slap in the face of all the recurring incidents of harassment of Filipino fishermen the swarming of Chinese vessels around Pagasa island and the unauthorized passage of doz

The next wave of attack against humanity has just been unleashed. The so-called novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is now spreading across Mainland China and with the Chinese New Year travel surge underway Chinas residents are exporting the virus everywhere. Confirmed cases have cropped up in Taiwan and the CDC has confirmed that at least one patient in the United States has been infected and hospitalized (after being misdiagnosed for a week during which he most likely spread the infections to others).

NOTE: Natural News is currently functioning in emergency mode after suffering a severe cyberattack that has temporarily disconnected us from our own data servers. Site functionality is minimal until we restore full connectivity. Thank you for your prayers as we navigate this latest malicious attempt to silence our journalism.

As covered by Alt-Market:

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday confirmed the first U.S. case of a new coronavirus that has killed six people in China.

The CDC and Washington state officials said the man in his 30s was in good condition at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett. The symptoms presented Sunday and the diagnosis was confirmed Monday.

Nancy Messonnier director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases called the news concerning particularly in light of reports that the virus has begun to spread from person to person.

The confirmation of human-to-human spread in Asia certainly increases our concern Messonnier said.

The CDC which began enhanced health screenings last week at airports in San Francisco New York and Los Angeles said Atlanta and Chicago would be added to the list. All were traveling from Wuhan China – where the outbreak began – to the USA are rerouted to these airports.

Cases have been found spreading to Japan South Korea Thailand Taiwan the Philippines Australia and now the United States reports DC Clothesline.

Already in Mexico?
One case of coronavirus which has been confirmed in Mexico involves a 57-year-old Asian man whose stops included Tijuana Beijing and Wuhan where the outbreak is known to be spreading. According to Breitbart News According to a statement from the Tamaulipas Health Secretariat a level three health protocol was triggered after a college professor was identified as a possible carrier of Coronavirus.
This is serious business warned Dr. Peter Hotez Dean of the Molecular Virology and Microbiology Department at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston in a Breitbart interview. We are now seeing person-to-person spreading of the virus.

Hotez recommends that everyone get a flu vaccine by the way even though this years flu vaccine has nothing whatsoever to do with the coronavirus thats spreading in China.

Upwards of 20000 people already infected in China according to estimates
Chinese health authorities announced Wednesday that 440 confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) had been reported in 13 provincial-level regions in the country by the end of Tuesday reports The Big Wobble. According to Prof Neil Fergusons table (see below) of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London 440 confirmed cases is the equivalent of almost 20000 unconfirmed cases.
The Big Wobble goes on to explain Published 5 days ago 45 confirmed cases were the equivalent of up to 2000 cases Today 440 confirmed cases is therefore the equivalent of almost 20000 unconfirmed cases according to Prof Neil Ferguson.

The conclusion of Prof. Fergusons analysis:

The Wuhan outbreak of a novel coronavirus has likely caused substantially more cases of moderate or severe respiratory illness than currently reported.

Dave Hodges has also posted more details about patient zero in the United States.

A bioengineered weaponized viral strain
What seems obvious from the rapid adaption of this viral strain -- which has now achieved human-to-human transmission -- is that it has been engineered as a self-replicating weapon system to achieve the globalists depopulation goals.
The long incubation period that seems to be presently observed allows this viral strain to spread in stealth mode largely undetected until its payload fully activates. The longer the incubation period the more people are infected and become silent carriers (who may not even know they are infected).

Currently this coronavirus is believed to have a low fatality rate something less than 5%. However this may change as the viral strain adapts or is altered through transgenic effects emerging from exposure to other circulating viral strains. In other words viral strains can in certain cases recombine their proteins to create whole new strains. All this virus needs is to encounter a more de

The onset of what was an absolute nightmare. Im healthy no compromised immune system and there I was... dying. 
I felt fine working outside when my world collapsed...literally!. I was rushed to the  hospital where the idiots were ready to send me home with a virus. My boyfriend said NO WAY My condition rapidly began to decline and the wonderful infectious disease docs took over. They saved my life. This was caused from someones sneeze...AIRBORNE and all the handwashing in the world wouldnt of prevented it. So in the case of this Coronavirus I am fearful that the public will be misinformed.

From: Clarkson Student Health
Re: Novel Coronavirus Outbreak

For your information regarding the recent novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan China.

Background:

An outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan City was initially reported to the World Health Organization on December 31 2019. Chinese health authorities have now confirmed more than 470 infections and at least 17 deaths from infection with a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the cause of the outbreak (these numbers will unfortunately continue to change daily). Initially most patients had epidemiological links to a large seafood and animal market. Unfortunately human-to-human spread has now been verified and it has spread to at least five other countries with individual cases in Japan South Korea and the U.S. and five cases in Thailand. All of these cases originated in Wuhan China before traveling to these other countries.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause cold-like illnesses in people numerous other coronaviruses circulate among animals including camels cats bats and others. Rarely animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people and then spread between people such as has been seen with Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and now 2019-nCoV.

For now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has placed travel restrictions on traveling to Wuhan and the Province of Hubei in China. Clarkson further strongly recommends that its faculty staff and students do not travel to Wuhan or the Province of Hubei until more is known about this virus its spread and its fatality rate.

When to suspect you may be affected by the 2019-nCoV:

The CDC is using the following criteria in order to know when to suspect a case of 2019-nCoV:
1. Fever (100 degrees F 37.8 degrees C or higher) AND symptoms of lower respiratory illness (e.g. cough shortness of breath) – and in the last 14 days before symptom onset history of travel from Wuhan City China or close contact with a person who is under investigation for 2019-nCoV while that person was ill.
2. Fever OR symptoms of lower respiratory illness (e.g. cough shortness of breath) – and in the last 14 days before symptom onset close contact with an ill laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patient.

If you have traveled to Wuhan or the Province of Hubei in the last 14 days and have these symptoms you should immediately seek medical care.

Prevention:

It is important to remember that each of you also plays an important role in this effort. The most effective tool for safeguarding the health of our campus is for you to be vigilant about preventing yourself from becoming ill and taking exceptionally good care of yourself should you unfortunately become ill.

The same recommendations that you hear from medical authorities regarding protecting yourself from the flu are the same recommendations that are being applied to 2019-nCoV. Since this happens to be influenza season and this year it has been particularly bad in New York state it is a good idea for all of us to be following these recommendations:
• Wash your hands often especially after shaking hands with others (hand disinfectants may be used if there is no access to soap and water)
• Avoid close contact with people who are sick
• Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing
• Cover your mouth and nose with the inside of your elbow if you do not have a tissue
• Do not touch your eyes nose or mouth especially after contact with others
• Keep a three-foot one-meter distance between yourself and anyone who is ill
• Stay home if you have a fever and influenza-like symptoms and consider seeing your primary care provider depending on the severity and length of your symptoms. Do not return to work or school until you’ve had 24 hours without a fever. This is important to help limit the spread.","1031748413619862_2491357137658975","ClarksonCampusSafety"

Ralph Baric an infectious-disease researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill last week (November 9) published a study on his team’s efforts to engineer a virus with the surface protein of the SHC014 coronavirus found in horseshoe bats in China and the backbone of to one that causes human-like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in mice. The hybrid virus could infect human airway cells and caused disease in mice according to the team’s results which were published in Nature Medicine.

And just a FYI in China only 6 people..6!!! Only 6 people died from the “Chinese” Coronavirus out of 1.6 BILLION people!  That isn’t considered deadly in the least bit and the few hundred who did get the virus recovered just fine (just like the common cold).  We don’t need a vaccine for this.  A lot of these viruses don’t kill or harm us and our bodies protect us the best when we develop natural immunity for a lot of these non-fatal diseases.

The U.N. health agency issued its evaluation after Chinese authorities moved to lock down three cities indefinitely earlier in the day and canceled major public celebrations and gatherings in Beijing during the Lunar New Year holiday period to try to contain the evolving outbreak.

During a news conference in Geneva WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that while the epidemic was clearly a crisis in China “it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one.”

The steps taken by China to shut down cities with more than 18 million people are unprecedented in public health as countries typically shy away from such extreme measures.

Tedros said that while WHO’s role is to provide science-based recommendations “at the end of the day a sovereign country has the autonomy to do what it thinks is right.” However he added that WHO hoped the actions taken by China would be “short in duration.”

The decision not to declare a global emergency “should not be taken as a sign that WHO does not think the situation is serious or that we’re not taking it seriously. Nothing could be further from the truth” Tedros said. “WHO is following this outbreak every minute of every day.”

This should not be taken as a sign that WHO does not think the situation is serious. WHO is following this new coronavirus outbreak every minute of every day at country regional and global level. I will not hesitate to reconvene the committee at a moment’s notice if needed.

— Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (DrTedros) January 23 2020

The United Nations health agency made the decision after independent experts spent two days assessing information about the spread of the newly identified coronavirus.

“It’s too early to consider this as a public health emergency of international concern” Didier Houssin the chair of the emergency advisory committee said noting that the panel “was very divided almost 50-50.”

WHO defines a global emergency as an “extraordinary event” that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response. Previous global emergencies have been declared for crises including the emergence of Zika virus in the Americas the swine flu pandemic and polio.

A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources but may also prompt nervous foreign governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. Deciding whether an outbreak amounts to an international crisis therefore can also be politically fraught.

In 2014 WHO initially resisted declaring the devastating Ebola epidemic in West Africa to be a global emergency because it feared the announcement would anger Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone. The U.N. agency ultimately declared the Ebola outbreak as a global emergency after more than 1000 people had died and the virus had spread across multiple national borders.

Houssin suggested during the news conference in Geneva that China’s view of the outbreak was a factor in Thursday’s decision.

“The perception of this declaration by the international community in the most affected country by the people struggling with the virus certainly has to be considered” he said.

Hundreds of people infected with the new virus have fallen ill in China and 17 have died. The first cases appeared last month in Wuhan an industrial and transportation hub in central China.

Other cases have been reported in the United States Japan South Korea and Thailand. Singapore Vietnam and Hong Kong reported their first cases Thursday.

While airports in many major cities around the world have instituted health screenings for arriving passengers from China Tedros said that “for the moment WHO does not recommend any broader restrictions on travel or trade.”

Dr. Peter Piot director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that regardless of the decision not to declare an emergency many more resources were needed to stop the virus.

“There are still many missing pieces in the jigsaw puzzle to fully understanding this new virus which is spreading rapidly across China and most probably around the world” Piot said in a statement. “There cannot be any complacency as to the need for global action.”

Image: Weaponized coronavirus invades the USA as world panics over possible pandemic

(Natural News) The next wave of attack against humanity has just been unleashed. The so-called “novel coronavirus” (2019-nCoV) is now spreading across Mainland China and with the Chinese New Year travel surge under way China’s residents are “exporting” the virus everywhere. Confirmed cases have cropped up in Taiwan and the CDC has confirmed that at least one patient in the United States has been infected and hospitalized (after being misdiagnosed for a week during which he most likely spread the infections to others).

As covered by Alt Market:

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday confirmed the first U.S. case of a new coronavirus that has killed six people in China.

The CDC and Washington state officials said the man in his 30s was in good condition at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett. The symptoms presented Sunday and the diagnosis was confirmed Monday.

Nancy Messonnier director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases called the news “concerning” particularly in light of reports that the virus has begun to spread from person to person.

“The confirmation of human-to-human spread in Asia certainly increases our concern” Messonnier said.

The CDC which began enhanced health screenings last week at airports in San Francisco New York and Los Angeles said Atlanta and Chicago would be added to the list. All traveling from Wuhan China – where the outbreak began – to the USA are rerouted to these airports.

Cases have been found spreading to Japan South Korea Thailand Taiwan the Philippines Australia and now the United States reports DC Clothesline.

Already in Mexico?
One case of coronavirus which has been confirmed in Mexico involves a 57-year-old Asian man whose stops included Tijuana Beijing and Wuhan where the outbreak is known to be spreading. According to Breitbart News “According to a statement from the Tamaulipas Health Secretariat a level three health protocol was triggered after a college professor was identified as a possible carrier of Coronavirus.”

“This is serious business” warned Dr. Peter Hotez Dean of the Molecular Virology and Microbiology Department at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston in a Breitbart interview. “We are now seeing person-to-person spreading of the virus.”

Hotez recommends that everyone get a flu vaccine by the way even though this year’s flu vaccine has nothing whatsoever to do with the coronavirus that’s spreading in China.

Upwards of 20000 people already infected in China according to estimates
“Chinese health authorities announced Wednesday that 440 confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) had been reported in 13 provincial-level regions in the country by the end of Tuesday” reports The Big Wobble. “According to Prof Neil Ferguson’s table (see below) of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London 440 confirmed cases is the equivalent of almost 20000 unconfirmed cases.”

The Big Wobble goes on to explain “Published 5 days ago 45 confirmed cases was the equivalent of up to 2000 cases Today 440 confirmed cases is therefore the equivalent of almost 20000 unconfirmed cases according to Prof Neil Ferguson.”

The conclusion of Prof. Ferguson’s analysis:

It is likely that the Wuhan outbreak of a novel coronavirus has caused substantially more cases of moderate or severe respiratory illness than currently reported.

Dave Hodges has also posted more details about “patient zero” in the United States.

A bioengineered weaponized viral strain
What seems obvious from the rapid adaption of this viral strain — which has now achieved “human-to-human transmission” — is that it has been engineered as a self-replicating weapon system to achieve the globalists’ depopulation goals.

The long incubation period that seems to be presently observed allows this viral strain to spread in “stealth” mode largely undetected until its payload fully activates. The longer the incubation period the more people are infected and become silent carriers (who may not even know they are infected).

Currently this coronavirus is believed to have a low fatality rate something less than 5%. However this may change as the viral strain adapts or is altered through transgenic effects emerging from exposure to other circulating viral strains. In other words viral strains can in certain cases recombine their proteins to create whole new strains. All this virus needs is to encounter a more deadly “payload” and incorporate that genetic sequence into its own.

ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW

A new Chinese coronavirus a cousin of the SARS virus has infected hundreds since the outbreak began in Wuhan China in December. Scientist Leo Poon who first decoded the virus thinks it likely started in an animal and spread to humans.

What we know is it causes pneumonia and then doesnt respond to antibiotic treatment which is not surprising but then in terms of mortality SARS kills 10% of the individuals Poon a virologist at the School of Public Health at The University of Hong Kong said. Its not clear how deadly the Wuhan coronavirus will be.

The World Health Organization offered guidance to countries on how they can prepare for it including how to monitor for the sick and how to treat patients.

Here are the things you should know about a coronavirus.

Lo and behold now? three months hence and six days into the new wave?I am simply astounded at hearing how you describe your own amazement with the global confluence of events occurring absolutely everywhere while also curious whether there is merely one event telltale to the Jan. 1819 hand-off. Then the Wuhan coronavirus breaks out big today and market graphs everywhere all hop on the toboggan to end the week. How did you ever do it?! You’re truly a man of a thousand graces and I for one could not be more grateful.
Breaking the WEC to stay current with the latest today it has been conspicuously absent for me to have yet encountered the term “Black Swan” regarding this Wuhan event. Then it occurred to me: The term itself is a bit Johnny-come-lately and would not surprise me one bit it has flown the coop over maybe most could be seeking an oil of veracity through Socrates to throw on all these choppy waters.

It would be most interesting to see the traffic stats for AE and Socrates when such events as these take off.

REPLY: What you have to understand and why I am often so critical of analysis is that real analysis does NOT begin with a predetermined conclusion. What I am trying to reveal and why I put the very sources of what I have read into books like the Manipulating the World Economy is because the proper way of analysis is exploration. I have sought perhaps like Leonardo DaVinci to figure out how things actually work without some predetermined agenda. DaVinci dug up dead bodies to try to discover how we function.

All the research I have done is in that vein. So it is me trying to show the world hey look at this! My opinions and beliefs have been shaped by what I have encountered. I have never looked at research to prove a predetermined idea. That is where everyone goes wrong. Adam Smith’s Invisible Hand was hated by Keynes and so many others BECAUSE they do not like the way the world economy functions and they seek to manipulate it to perform as they desire. That is why economics is no longer a science but has degenerated into a political propaganda machine.

People judge me by everyone else. This turn in the Economic Confidence Model is not about me being right wrong smarter than everyone else or any other personal critique. This is about how the world truly functions and everything from weather to disease plays a role right down to this coronavirus which I am running our models to try to ascertain will this be a cyclical pandemic or an epidemic – a big difference!

All of my research has been a quest to understand how the world truly functions. It has always been:

Hey take a look at this! Here is order hidden behind the mask of chaos!

Every single action has an equal and opposite reaction. This is why I taught Socrates how to look for patterns and how to analyze those patterns. I have warned that the 2020 election will be notorious and will mark a rise in violence. People are unwilling to accept the vote of the people. If they lose they blamed Russia for everything. Democracy is dying along with civility. I am not interested in being right I wish I was wrong.

We are faced with the collapse in Democracy our model forecast back in 1985 would begin 2015.75. Politicians like Adam Schiff are the poster child for absolute corruption and dishonesty. This type of behavior has never been seen and is merely an attempt to put a Democrat in the White House who will raise taxes and devastate the business community in the spirit of “progressiveness” which is the new politically correct label for Marxism.

This is all part of the decline and fall of the West and the shift in the Financial Capital of the World back to Asia. It does not matter who wins in 2020 the other side will never accept the winner.","100001138710471_2750077028373561","hermantalmadge"

Everything Points to Biowarfare Being Used Against China
by the Western Powers Which Seek to Contain Her
Growing Power and Influence in the World
Given the multiple and serious woes that China has suffered from during 2019 it comes as no surprise that the Western powers would now resort to bioweaponry.

WEAPONIZED CORONAVIRUS: “Bioengineered as a self-replicating weapon system”
If there’s one last hit to the economy that China doesn’t need right now it’s a global pandemic that ‘supposedly’ originated in Wuhan the sprawling capital of Central China’s Hubei province (see map below with the red marker identifying Wuhan).

See how Wuhan is located right in the center of China’s highly productive southeast region—the economic powerhouse of the nation.  This strategic location was selected for the biological attack because of the easily engineered vectors of disease dissemination as depicted by the map above.  Paralyzing China’s economic and financial sectors is after all a primary goal of this essentially Anglo-American black operation. See: Why the coronavirus is a real threat to China’s economy

In light of the US-staged Hong Kong protests U.S. tariff regime against China threat of economic sanctions against nations working with Huawei CIA-inflamed Xinjiang conflict involving the Muslim Uyghurs provocative sailing of US Navy warships through the Taiwan Strait transparent political prosecution of Huawei’s CFO ravaging of China’s pig farms by a bioengineered virus etc. the Chinese government has been under withering attack since 2018.

When so many debilitating assaults are suspiciously happening at once what can China do except deal with them in a manner so as to expose the true culprits.  However China is not likely to do that in the case of this intensifying bio-war being waged by the West.

SARS conspiracy theory
The original SARS pandemic that took place in China after the turn of the millennium was also well-known in bio-medical circles as a naked act of biowarfare.  Like this year’s coronavirus bio-attack in Wuhan the bioengineered SARS outbreak also involved a highly coordinated campaign of propaganda and disinformation. See: Is the new ‘deadly China virus’ a covert operation?

However the administration of Xi Jinping is much too concerned about the panic that would inevitably result if the populace was informed of a full-blown bioweapon attack.  The precipitating chaos would simply overwhelm the government in Beijing which is already on serious overload because of the endless interference by the Anglo-American Axis.

The SARS outbreak that occurred from 2002 to 2003 has already shown that China is not willing to release the hard scientific evidence that proves the premeditated release of a bioengineered coronavirus.

The following excerpt from Wikipedia explains some of the background of SARS—the Severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic that took place primarily in mainland China and Hong Kong but also in Canada and other countries.

Excerpt from SARS conspiracy theory

Wuhan Coronavirus of 2020
The rapidly spreading Wuhan coronavirus also known as Novel coronavirus that was first reported in 2019 has all the hallmarks of yet another bioengineered virus in a U.S. Military laboratory.

What follows is a short description form Wikipedia of this Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

Time will tell whether this deadly coronavirus was released into the Chinese population with the intent to kill and sicken scare and intimidate.  The intimidation phase of such an ongoing black operation is certainly aimed at the government in Beijing which refuses to be coerced and threatened by the Trump administration.

Because the highly disruptive Western-backed Hong Kong protests have yet to yield the result desired by the U.S. State Department it was only a matter of time before the C.I.A. implemented Plan B…or is this Plan C or D?

KEY POINT: The replication process (see diagram above) of this particular coronavirus and how quickly it mutates andor adapts to various pharmaceutical treatment regimens will reveal exactly how this pathogenic microorganism was bioengineered.

Why China?

Xi’s remarks of a “grave” situation came as China kicked off its traditional New Year’s celebrations amid a backdrop of caution and stark measures seeking to contain the virus.

At least 48 million people were ordered on lockdown in central China with a travel ban covering 15 cities in the central Hubei province where the virus was first encountered. Heres what we know:
?Hong Kong announced that its schools would be closed until Feb. 17 to try to limit the possibility of transmission.

?The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that a second person in the United States has been diagnosed with coronavirus.

?Infections have been confirmed in France South Korea Japan Nepal Thailand Singapore Vietnam Taiwan Australia and the United States. We’re mapping the spread here.

?Travel bans were extended in central China to put tens of millions of people effectively on local lockdowns. In Wuhan where the virus was first detected workers are racing to build a 1000-bed hospital.

?Authorities around China including in the capital Beijing have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that accompany the Spring Festival to avoid having large public gatherings where the airborne virus could spread.
12:10 PM: Virus worries mute some holiday celebrations in Seattle area

SEATTLE — About 30 minutes south of the hospital caring for the man with the first confirmed U.S. coronavirus infection some Chinese Americans in Seattle changed their plans for their biggest holiday of the year to avoid any chance of contact with someone who might be infected.

One woman who declined to give her name said she canceled her family’s restaurant reservations for Lunar New Year in favor of dinner at home. She said she doubted she’d be making a Chinese feast either. Out of an abundance of caution she said she didn’t want to go to the Asian market to buy ingredients.

The Northwest Chinese School with locations in Bellevue Wash. and Seattle sent out an email calling off weekend classes for preschoolers through adults. “We take the health of our students and families very seriously and think that this is the best course of action” officials wrote.

And on the University of Washington campus in Seattle a Chinese student association distributed face masks in Red Square a central hub paved with red bricks. Students were asked to contribute to efforts to send supplies such as face masks and protective suits to China.

11:50 AM: Wildlife market remains under study as possible virus vector

TOKYO — Health experts say China failed to learn one of the most important lessons of the SARS outbreak eight years ago — that wild animal markets are a potent breeding ground for disease with the possibility of ailments jumping to humans.

SARS was thought to have originated in masked palm civets tree-dwelling mammals native to parts of Asia. The trigger point for the current coronavirus remains unclear but scientists are looking closely at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan. Despite its name the market also appeared to be selling live cats and dogs wild chickens snakes and marmots.

China implemented controls on wildlife markets after the SARS epidemic but those controls soon evaporated. The country remains a major consumer of wild and endangered animals for meat as well as in traditional medicine. The SARS outbreak claimed more than 750 lives in China and other countries.

A study published in the Lancet medical journal Friday confirmed the current outbreak is a new form of coronavirus which is closest to the SARS-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.

Some scientists believe another species was involved in transmitting the disease to humans but no consensus has yet emerged on which animal with theories ranging from snakes to mink.

11:30 AM: China tour groups blocked from overseas trips 

China is suspending all tour groups from journeys outside the country state media reported in another attempt to keep the virus from possibly spreading to new regions and countries.

The order could have a wide impact across China. The Lunar New Year holiday which began Friday is the busiest time in China for travel and package tour vacations.

Tour groups in the middle of their trips will be able to continue their itineraries state media reported but cautioned that travelers’ health should be closely monitored. Earlier Saturday authorities announced plans to temporarily halt inter-province buses to and from Beijing beginning Sunday.

1242020 — The world is watching China where a new outbreak of deadly coronavirus has caused dozens of deaths and infected hundreds. However the Chinese government may not be telling the public everything they know.  One America’s Jack Posobiec sat down with a Chinese reporter to learn more. 

Tim Graham executive editor of NewsBusters noted that Stephanopoulos could be seen on camera making the gesture at about 3:00 P.M. EST Friday. The clip showed a Capitol Hill reporter asking Sekulow questions about Attorney General William Barr Sen. Lindsey Graham and lawyer Alan Dershowitz all making the argument that abuse of power is impeachable. 

“We’ve got something very different from what you’re hearing up here” Sekulow replied. “We’ve got lawyers that will be put forward when our side of the case goes that represents multiple schools of thought on what is an impeachable offense” Sekulow continued. “They have one thing in common: that the actions alleged and the actions of the president do not reach that level — no matter which school of thought you’re on.” 

BUSTED! 
As Sekulow began to take another question viewers could see Stephanopoulos on camera making a throat-slitting gesture to order the end of the broadcast’s feed. Stephanopoulos then immediately went to a panel segment to discuss the Sekulow’s remarks. 
“Dude we SEE you!” Tim Graham wrote on Twitter. 

“These guys are NOT going to like hearing the Trump side of this trial” Graham said in his previous tweet. That might be an understatement! The mainstream media has been anti-Trump throughout his presidency. The sentiment comes through as subtle bias or explicit hatred for this President.
George Stephanopoulos appeared Friday to show us exactly what he and his news outlet thinks of Team Trump. We already know what they think.

The Government has put in place various measures to protect our people including starting temperature screenings at our checkpoints. 

Ministry of Culture Community and Youth - MCCY has also taken measures. We have stepped up cleaning regimes at our public facilities such as museums and ActiveSG gyms. 

We can all do our part to be socially responsible and show consideration for one another. We should practise good personal hygiene and see a doctor if we are unwell. More importantly please take care of those around us who might need extra help. 

Do monitor Ministry of Health Singapore’s website (https:www.moh.gov.sg2019-ncov-wuhan) for the latest advisories and avoid sharing unverified news that might cause unnecessary alarm or ill will among communities. 

Let us stay calm look out for one another and continue to enjoy the festive period. My deepest thanks to everyone who is working hard during this time to ensure our safety.

Worrisome. Please read.
This was just in my feed. It is a copy paste because it cant be shared. The comments say it was on a page discussion about the virus and posted by a student in Wuhan:

A CHINESE STUDENT FROM WUHAN BEGAN POSTING ON site called GODLIKE PRODUCTIONS ABOUT 3 HRS AGO! WHAT HE HAD TO SAY WAS EXTREMELY WORRISOME. I BELIEVE THAT HE HAS BEEN TELLING THE TRUTH.”

01222020 03:21 PM
I am Chinese from Wuhan no one can leave the city or enter the city total cases here is 170 dead over 5000 infected
We cannot leave the city anymore we cannot allow others to enter the city the army is guarding all exit-entry point. All forms of mass transit are on lockdown including the airport they will let us all die here
Ive seen soldiers in full hazmat suits here in Hanyang from my second-floor apartment window they are spraying something fluid on the streets via large trucks using water cannons
USING VPN here it is not allowed to talk-criticize about the virus a jail sentence is sure if one does
Fang Zhong within the institute people are very very alarmed of what will happen to us
I know personally that at least two IOPCAS scientists have been put under house arrest the virus is not what the WEST thinks it is much more dangerous because it mutates from person to person at first slightly but could re-emerge under total different form within weeks
Our colleagues counted over 5000 cases within the city center as of yesterday at 1pm
They will never let us leave the city because the virus will spread within exponentially doubling every two days this is extremely contagious the virus stays in the air for 24 to 48 hours
People will panic the sun rises very soon most are unaware that the city is on total lockdown
In the Baofeng sector alone our colleagues counted 1400 cases many people have disappeared their loved ones searching for them in hospitals
I go to Central China University I am from Changsha
Do you have somewhere stocked with supplies where you can shelter in place for a few weeks (or months) where you can wait it out? Is your family trapped in the city with you?
Quoting: Anonymous Coward 77547432
No in China it is not possible cameras see everything we would be labeled as enemies and traitors we must stay put and wait from Central Party orders
There is panic and chaos in all are Wuhan hospitals people are disappearing with no trace and nobodies are found
Stay safe. What is the origin of this virus? I heard it originated from the local food market. Probably some kind of animal was the source.
Quoting: Anonymous Coward 78370173
They say here Guinea pigs
All my family is outside the city so they will be ok they live in a rural area we fear about the water we are wondering if the water gets infected what do we do?
No more N95 mask can be found since last Sunday not one left in the city
When people wake up the entire city will want to leave its going to be crazy most people here are sleeping and dont know they cant exit the city
I see people leaving in my apartment block light are starting to blink people are waking up and hearing the news my neighbor is leaving they say the roads are still free to get out of Wuhan I dont know but there will be huge traffic jams
The last planes are landing at the airport and the people dont know they wont be able to leave
Thank you yes Im staying put the University will be closed I think
A convoy of large army trucks here in Yuanbaoshan area in Wuhan
That was nothing he needed help with electric wires no more power.
It is confirmed the army is securing roadblocks at all entry-exit points in Wuhan they say it is a massive operation
There are many people living here who are very poor with bad health supplies wont be coming in anymore or very little
Our running water system is very weak if the workers cannot get transportation to the plant it will shut down (I got the answer to the question earlier)
I am leaving with a small cart my neighbor gave me for helping him going to buy as much food and drinking water as possible my supermarket opens in 20 min
 The Wuhan Virus is now being called WARS (Wuhan Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as it is closely related to SARS .

Dr. Yuen Kwok Yung a highly respected doctor during the previous SARS period gave the following advice in a speech yesterday.
?????????????????????????????????????

1. He suggests Hong Kong people should try to avoid going to China during this period of time.
???????????

2. If going on a flight make sure you wear a mask.
???????????????.

3. Always have antiseptic cleanser or towel readily available.
????????????????

4. The virus “Coronavirus” is similar type of virus like the previous SARS or MERS. This time it is OC43. There is still no known method of tackling this virus.
????????????????????????????

5. If you have to go to the market make sure you wear a mask. Be very vigilant.
(????????????????????)

6. Health Authority announced that this virus is very serious. ?????????????????? However  as the virus is found to be able to enter your body if your throat or throat mucous is dry ?????????????????????????????????????? the one precaution they suggest which can be taken is to ensure your throat or throat mucous is always in a moist condition. ???????????????????In fact they suggest not to allow your throat to become dry as in 10 minutes of being dry the virus will find ways to enter into your body. ???????????10???????????????????So do not refrain from drinking water always have a bottle handy. ???????????
For adults they suggest drinking 50-80cc of warm water for children 30-50cc. Just drink if you feel your throat is dry. Do not hesitate.?????????????????????50-80cc??????30-50cc? However drinking more than the amount recommended is not necessary as it will just want to pass through your system. The idea is to “Keep your Throat Constantly Moist”
????????????????????????

7. Before end of March try not to enter crowded places MTR or public Transport and wear a mask if necessary.
??3??????????????????????????????????????

8. Avoid eating too much deep fried food and take plenty of Vitamen C.
?????????????????C?

9. Control Centre advice on symptoms of this virus: (??) 
- fast and high fever hard to lower but if successful the fever will return very soon.
????????????????????
- next stage is coughing in long duration people affected are mainly children.
?????????????????????
- Adults has mainly throat symptoms together with headaches and physical discomforts.
?????????????????????
- the virus is “highly” contagious.

Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have long been considered inconsequential pathogens causing the “common cold” in otherwise healthy people. However in the 21st century 2 highly pathogenic HCoVs—severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)—emerged from animal reservoirs to cause global epidemics with alarming morbidity and mortality. In December 2019 yet another pathogenic HCoV 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was recognized in Wuhan China and has caused serious illness and death. The ultimate scope and effect of this outbreak is unclear at present as the situation is rapidly evolving.

Coronaviruses are large enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses that can be divided into 4 genera: alpha beta delta and gamma of which alpha and beta CoVs are known to infect humans.1 Four HCoVs (HCoV 229E NL63 OC43 and HKU1) are endemic globally and account for 10% to 30% of upper respiratory tract infections in adults. Coronaviruses are ecologically diverse with the greatest variety seen in bats suggesting that they are the reservoirs for many of these viruses.2 Peridomestic mammals may serve as intermediate hosts facilitating recombination and mutation events with expansion of genetic diversity. The surface spike (S) glycoprotein is critical for binding of host cell receptors and is believed to represent a key determinant of host range restriction.1

Until recently HCoVs received relatively little attention due to their mild phenotypes in humans. This changed in 2002 when cases of severe atypical pneumonia were described in Guangdong Province China causing worldwide concern as disease spread via international travel to more than 2 dozen countries.2 The new disease became known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and a beta-HCoV named SARS-CoV was identified as the causative agent. Because early cases shared a history of human-animal contact at live game markets zoonotic transmission of the virus was strongly suspected.3 Palm civets and raccoon dogs were initially thought to be the animal reservoir(s) however as more viral sequence data became available consensus emerged that bats were the natural hosts.

Common symptoms of SARS included fever cough dyspnea and occasionally watery diarrhea.2 Of infected patients 20% to 30% required mechanical ventilation and 10% died with higher fatality rates in older patients and those with medical comorbidities. Human-to-human transmission was documented mostly in health care settings. This nosocomial spread may be explained by basic virology: the predominant human receptor for the SARS S glycoprotein human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is found primarily in the lower respiratory tract rather than in the upper airway. Receptor distribution may account for both the dearth of upper respiratory tract symptoms and the finding that peak viral shedding occurred late (?10 days) in illness when individuals were already hospitalized. SARS care often necessitated aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation which also may have contributed to the prominent nosocomial spread.

Several important transmission events did occur in the community such as the well-characterized mini-outbreak in the Hotel Metropole in Hong Kong from where infected patrons traveled and spread SARS internationally. Another outbreak occurred at the Amoy Gardens housing complex where more than 300 residents were infected providing evidence that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV can sometimes occur.4 Nearly 20 years later the factors associated with transmission of SARS-CoV ranging from self-limited animal-to-human transmission to human superspreader events remain poorly understood.

Ultimately classic public health measures brought the SARS pandemic to an end but not before 8098 individuals were infected and 774 died.2 The pandemic cost the global economy an estimated $30 billion to $100 billion.1 SARS-CoV demonstrated that animal CoVs could jump the species barrier thereby expanding perception of pandemic threats.

In 2012 another highly pathogenic beta-CoV made the species jump when Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was recognized and MERS-CoV was identified in the sputum of a Saudi man who died from respiratory failure.3 Unlike SARS-CoV which rapidly spread across the globe and was contained and eliminated in relatively short order MERS has smoldered characterized by sporadic zoonotic transmission and limited chains of human spread. MERS-CoV has not yet sustained community spread instead it has caused explosive nosocomial transmission events in some cases linked to a single superspreader which are devastating for health care syste

Scale of China’s Wuhan Shutdown Is Believed to Be Without Precedent

In sealing off a city of 11 million people China is trying to halt a coronavirus outbreak using a tactic with a complicated history of ethical concerns.

Jan. 22 2020

In closing off Wuhan a city of more than 11 million people China deployed on Thursday morning a centuries-old public health tactic to prevent the spread of infectious disease — this time a mysterious respiratory infection caused by a coronavirus.
Experts said the stunning scale of the shutdown isolating a major urban transit hub larger than New York City was without precedent.
“It’s an unbelievable undertaking” said Dr. Howard Markel a professor of the history of medicine at the University of Michigan adding that he had never heard of so many people being cordoned off as a disease-prevention measure.
Still “people are going to get out” he said. “It’s going to be leaky.”
By Thursday evening China said it planned to extend the shutdown even further. Officials said they would impose travel restrictions on at least four other nearby cities — Huanggang Ezhou Chibi and Zhijiang — affecting millions more residents.

Bmitingovements of millions of people in an attempt to protect public health China is engaging in a balancing act with a long and complicated history fraught with social political and ethical concerns.

 Read the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak.

James G. Hodge Jr. director of the Center for Public Health Law and Policy at Arizona State University said the shutdown would almost certainly lead to human rights violations and would be patently unconstitutional in the United States.
“It could very easily backfire” he said adding that the restrictions could prevent healthy people from fleeing the city perhaps exposing them to greater risk of infection. “In general this is risky business.”

China’s expanding measures

To combat the spread of the virus which first appeared at the end of December and has killed at least 17 people and sickened more than 600 the Chinese government said it would cancel planes and trains leaving Wuhanbeginning Thursday and suspend buses subways and ferries within it.
In Huanggang a city of seven million about 30 miles east of Wuhan residents would not be allowed to leave the city without special permission according to a government statement. In Ezhou which has about one million residents all rail stations were to be closed.

Wuhan Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak

The virus has sickened more than 1300 people in China and a handful in other countries.

Jan. 21 2020

The practice of isolating people and goods to halt the spread of disease dates at least to the 14th century when ships arriving in Venice during the plague epidemic were required to anchor off the coast for 40 days. The isolation period gave rise to the term quarantine from the Italian quaranta giorni meaning 40 days according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Professor Hodge said quarantines could be effective if they selectively isolate only those who have been infected or are suspected of infection. The response in Wuhan with the establishment of a “cordon sanitaire”-type boundary goes much further than that.
“Quarantine would be saying ‘You can’t leave your own home can’t go to school work or church’” he said. But the Chinese authorities “have drawn a line around this city and said ‘No one in and no one out.’ That type of thing is obviously an excessive response.”

History and ‘the darker side of quarantine’

In recent years governments have imposed other large-scale measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
Sierra Leone a country of about seven million people said “everybody” was expected to stay indoors for three days in September 2014 as 7000 teams of health and community workers went door to door to find hidden Ebola patients.

Earlier that year Liberian officials placed West Point a sprawling slum in Monrovia where 60000 to 120000 people were crammed into shacks under an Ebola quarantine. The order led to deadly clashes with soldiers and may have helped to spread the disease experts said forcing people to crowd together for basic humanitarian aid.
During the SARS outbreak of 2003 Canadian health officials asked anyone in Ontario who had even one symptom of the respiratory infection to stay home for a few days out of fear that the disease might spread during the Easter holiday weekend.
In Beijing at least 4000 residents who had been expose

“Ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars. … For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. ”

ii: Nations are constantly at war- most likely flashpoints for world war in 2020.??
1: Iran and Israel are already waging low-intensity war across the Middle East.
2: South China Sea:
U.S.-China relations stand at a precarious point. A trade deal between the two countries would seem to alleviate some tensions but implementation remains in question.
3: The tension of Kashmir- the gap in conventional power between India and Pakistan has only grown even as Pakistan has tried to heal that gap with nuclear weapons.
4: USA vs IRAN- the cost of an erratic president. 

iii: Diseases- Well its obviously the latest from Wuhan Coronavirus spreading widely in different countries that are infections have been confirmed in the following:
1.Australia
2. France
3.South Korea
4.Japan
5.Nepal
6.Thailand
7.Singapore
8.Vietnam
9.Taiwan and 
10.United States.
Authorities are enforcing a lockdown who are affected. ???

iv: The activities of Volcanoes around the world.
1. Taal Vocano PH
We have been warned of calamities and told to prepare for them.

The Lord gives these signs to help us. We can put our lives in order and prepare ourselves and our families for those things yet to come.

--A recording from a dinner with President Trump attended by accused campaign fraudsters Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman resulted in audio in which President Trump says repeatedly of Ukrainian Ambassador Janet Yavonovitch “take her out.” As long as he didn’t mean “kill her” I don’t think this is illegal. It does however make a good chapter in a Mario Puzzo novel. If this Parnas character had crossed the Clintons like this he’d be dead already (probably by suicide). I believe our President had to take a back channel approach at a private dinner because using traditional diplomatic channels would have resulted in him being challenged because Yavonovitch was a highly regarded senior diplomat appointed by President Reagan. https:www.msn.comen-canewsnewspoliticstake-her-out-recording-appears-to-capture-trump-talking-about-firing-ambassadorar-BBZilIZ?fbclid=IwAR1SkpF1f_x5A_vWLIm79lqqLFXC8jv4rrr1QTg6zicWgVDn58FGFz6cILU

Theres a song called Golden Years I put in this post.  It says some important things that I havent mentioned in this post of mine.

You gotta remember this Stephen King Movie Golden Years. Was one of my favorite Stephen King Stories. A must Understand. Talks of cover ups and an elderly man who gets younger and younger. I have an awesome habit of analyzing things. One day I realized that movies from many years ago talk of what happened of our recent past. How does this happen? Theres a serious empathic ability that goes on in the minds of creative writers that are so famous now a days. Many movies from many Different people have been writing stories that actually (somehow) do this kind of being a very different type of Predicting that these writers are not aware that they are doing. Whos doing it? Whos the non-seen influencers that are really using telepathic communication (Channeling as do some present day military have accomplished.  Did I just say that?) to get these past writers to use the right kind of story to write true future events for someone to understand that these are messages for us to figure out as a prediction. Ive only realized this after the predicted event has happened. Who can be one who realizes that a true event is about to happen from this type of decoding.  Different not strange.

Heres an example of such story predictions that I just talked about.

Theres a deformed Ebola Virus in the movie Outbreak. It also talks of cover ups and two people in charge of this cover up. One of the two has a strong merciful insight and is the one who stops a catastrophic outcome.

It stars Dustin Hoffman Rene Russo and Morgan Freeman and co-stars Cuba Gooding Jr. Kevin Spacey Donald Sutherland and Patrick Dempsey. The film focuses on an outbreak of a fictional Ebola-like virus Motaba in Zaire and later in a small town in the United States.

Directed by: Wolfgang Petersen
Country: United States

... In the urban dictionary Motaba is also a definition for: 3.) A bug which is more psychological than physical and spreads rapidly among people with little to no physical contact.

It talks a bit about this outbreak of the coronavirus.  It didnt start in China.

---------------------------------------------------------------

I 1st realized this movie predictions phenomena after I saw a movie for the third time called King Kong. This movie I 1st seen in its 1930s original version. Then I saw it in the Jeff Bridges 1980s version. Then after I saw it in its Jack Black version I thought of all those versions and somehow my mind started putting together certain simularities of symbols and metaphors in these movies and how they talked of what recent event happened that changed our history books. This way of decoding movies that came from famous stories is a type of a Low Latent Inhibitions way of using their special senses to figure the extra senses of perception. Watching the Movies of the story King Kong I realized a horrible thing about a cover up from a certain government of a certain country of years ago.

I am so extremely saddened to know the reality of what this prediction discloses from decoding the hidden messages in the movie King Kong.

Please look over these movies and try to understand what Im talking about.","143473806309929_505991006724872","maryellen.matthews.7564"

Kobe Bryant 41 the legendary basketball star who spent 20 years with the Los Angeles Lakers was killed when the helicopter he was traveling in crashed and burst into flames Sunday morning amid foggy conditions in the hills above Calabasas sources told the Los Angeles Times.

His daughter Gianna 13 was also on board and died along with three others.

Bryant’s death stunned Los Angeles and the sports world which mourned one of basketball’s greatest players. Sources said the helicopter took off from Orange County where Bryant lived.

Kobe Bryant’s death: Live updates and remembrance
Jan. 26 2020
The crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road south of Agoura Road according to a watch commander for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

Jerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter unusually low struggling overhead. “It didn’t sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy” Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.

The Times is offering coverage of Kobe Bryant’s death for free today. Please consider a subscription to support our journalism.

“There was a big fireball” he said. “No one could survive that.”

The helicopter a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991 departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday according to publicly available flight records. The helicopter passed over Boyle Heights near Dodger Stadium and circled over Glendale during the flight.

The National Transportation Safety Board database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for this aircraft. The helicopter is registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp. according to the California Secretary of State business database.

“We extend our sincerest condolences to all those affected by today’s Sikorsky S-76B accident in Calabasas California” the helicopter’s manufacturer Sikorsky said in a tweet. “We have been in contact with the NTSB and stand ready to provide assistance and support to the investigative authorities and our customer.”

“Kobe Bryant was a giant who inspired amazed and thrilled people everywhere with his incomparable skill on the court — and awed us with his intellect and humility as a father husband creative genius and ambassador for the game he loved” L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a news statement Sunday afternoon. “He will live forever in the heart of Los Angeles and will be remembered through the ages as one of our greatest heroes.”

Across Southern California public figures and fans alike mourned the basketball star Sunday.

“Particularly when he was young to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow watch him grow this is one of the most tragic days of my life” said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West 81. West was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant’s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted. “I know somewhere along the way I guess I’ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court but more importantly he was going to make a difference off the court and he was making a difference off the court. It’s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.”

It was a sad and surreal scene inside Staples Center around noon Sunday where Grammy Awards dress rehearsal was taking place as word of Bryant’s death swept through the arena. Crews worked quickly to move Bryant’s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m. the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side illuminated by flood lights.

News of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor as staff and observers watched in disbelief.

Within half an hour of the news breaking a Barnes & Noble in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring the former NBA star.

“It’s kind of morose but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it “ said Armando Romero a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant’s death to the booksellers over their wireless headsets.“We knew right away people would be coming.”

Minutes later Romero said he received phone calls from customers asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.

January 22 2020 by Mike Adams editor Natural News

The next wave of attack against humanity has just been unleashed. The so-called “novel coronavirus” (2019-nCoV) is now spreading across Mainland China and with the Chinese New Year travel surge under way China’s residents are “exporting” the virus everywhere. Confirmed cases have cropped up in Taiwan and the CDC has confirmed that at least one patient in the United States has been infected and hospitalized (after being misdiagnosed for a week during which he most likely spread the infections to others).

NOTE: Natural News is currently functioning in “emergency” mode after suffering a severe cyber attack that has temporarily disconnected us from our own data servers. Site functionality is very limited until we restore full connectivity. Thank you for your prayers as we navigate this latest malicious attempt to silence our journalism.

As covered by Alt Market:

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday confirmed the first U.S. case of a new coronavirus that has killed six people in China.

The CDC and Washington state officials said the man in his 30s was in good condition at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett. The symptoms presented Sunday and the diagnosis was confirmed Monday.

Nancy Messonnier director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases called the news “concerning” particularly in light of reports that the virus has begun to spread from person to person.

“The confirmation of human-to-human spread in Asia certainly increases our concern” Messonnier said.

The CDC which began enhanced health screenings last week at airports in San Francisco New York and Los Angeles said Atlanta and Chicago would be added to the list. All traveling from Wuhan China – where the outbreak began – to the USA are rerouted to these airports.

Cases have been found spreading to Japan South Korea Thailand Taiwan the Philippines Australia and now the United States reports DC Clothesline.

Already in Mexico?
One case of coronavirus which has been confirmed in Mexico involves a 57-year-old Asian man whose stops included Tijuana Beijing and Wuhan where the outbreak is known to be spreading. According to Breitbart News “According to a statement from the Tamaulipas Health Secretariat a level three health protocol was triggered after a college professor was identified as a possible carrier of Coronavirus.””This is serious business” warned Dr. Peter Hotez Dean of the Molecular Virology and Microbiology Department at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston in a Breitbart interview. “We are now seeing person-to-person spreading of the virus.”

Hotez recommends that everyone get a flu vaccine by the way even though this year’s flu vaccine has nothing whatsoever to do with the coronavirus that’s spreading in China.

Upwards of 20000 people already infected in China according to estimates
“Chinese health authorities announced Wednesday that 440 confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) had been reported in 13 provincial-level regions in the country by the end of Tuesday” reports The Big Wobble. “According to Prof Neil Ferguson’s table (see below) of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London 440 confirmed cases is the equivalent of almost 20000 unconfirmed cases.”The Big Wobble goes on to explain “Published 5 days ago 45 confirmed cases was the equivalent of up to 2000 cases Today 440 confirmed cases is therefore the equivalent of almost 20000 unconfirmed cases according to Prof Neil Ferguson.”

The conclusion of Prof. Ferguson’s analysis:

It is likely that the Wuhan outbreak of a novel coronavirus has caused substantially more cases of moderate or severe respiratory illness than currently reported.

Dave Hodges has also posted more details about “patient zero” in the United States.

A bioengineered weaponized viral strain
What seems obvious from the rapid adaption of this viral strain — which has now achieved “human-to-human transmission” — is that it has been engineered as a self-replicating weapon system to achieve the globalists’ depopulation goals.The long incubation period that seems to be presently observed allows this viral strain to spread in “stealth” mode largely undetected until its payload fully activates. The longer the incubation period the more people are infected and become silent carriers (who may not even know they are infected).

Currently this coronavirus is believed to have a low fatality rate something less than 5%. However this may change as the viral strain adapts or is altered through transgenic effects emerging from exposure to other circulating viral strains. In other words viral strains can in cert

Vemos por todos lados noticias del nuevo coronavirus que apareció en China. Las autoridades sanitarias de ese país han actuado con celeridad y han identificado y aislado al virus como sabemos. Se han presentado casos en otros cuatro países uno en los Estados Unidos. 
Este tipo de noticias siempre provoca una compresible alarma en la población pero hasta el momento la información que tenemos es incompleta y cambia minuto a minuto. 

Lo que no debemos hacer:
Buscar información en las redes sociales plagadas de fake news información falsa total o parcialmente que busca confundir y causar pánico.  
Tomar medidas basándose en información dudosa o falsa. Por ejemplo: salir a las farmacias en tropel a buscar cubrebocas a precio de oro como hace algunos años por la influenza H1N1 o alejarse como del diablo de cualquiera que estornude. 

Lo que sí debemos hacer: 
Buscar información en fuentes confiables. Están al alcance las páginas de la OMS de la CDC de la OPS (Organización Panamericana de la Salud) y las autoridades mexicanas están alerta. La CONAVE (Comité Nacional para la la Vigilancia Epidemiológica) está tomando las medidas pertinentes. 
Busca fuentes serias y oficiales. 

Lo más importante:
Se previene igual que la influenza y de esta sí tenemos así que atención a esto:

* Lavado de manos frecuente con agua y jabón durante al menos 20 segundos.
* Evitar tocarse los ojos nariz o boca sin haberse lavado las manos.
* Evitar contacto directo con personas que estén enfermas.
* Evitar y evitarle a tus hijos lugares concurridos.

La información se irá actualizando día con día.  Hay que estar atentos a las recomendaciones de nuestras autoridades de salud que siempre han actuado con eficacia ejemplar.

An Interview with Liu Qing-quan a Chinese Medical physician and scholar who lead a nationwide team of Chinese medical experts in designing a treatment protocol for Wuhan Coronavirus.

(Chinese version originally published in “Health Report” (???) by journalist Wang Ning (??) http:mini.eastday.coma200126020132257.html)

On January 21 Beijing Chinese Medical Hospital Chief Liu Qing-quan and China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Guang-an-men Hospital Emergency Department Chief Qi Wen-sheng arrived in Wu-han as part of the first delegation of Chinese Medical Specialists appointed by the National Administrative Bureau of Chinese Medicine and the National Health Bureau to take part in the frontline battle against Coronavirus.

These two specialists have now returned to Beijing. In an exclusive interview this morning Health Daily journalist Wang Ning sat down and spoke with Liu Qing-quan about his experience in Wu-han.

We should note that in 2003 during the SARS epidemic Liu Qing-quan was among the first to begin treating patients in epidemic-afflicted areas. He led a team of doctors saving patients and learning as he went. He also was part of a team of specialists that drafted an integrative medicine guideline for treatment. His work was instrumental in limiting and controlling the spread of SARS.

The following content has been adapted from a recording of our interview with Hospital Chief Liu Qing-quan.

How was the Chinese Medical treatment protocol formulated?

The four methods of diagnosis (observation auscultation and olfaction interrogation and pulse feeling) are central to Chinese medical diagnosis and treatment and to some degree they are even more important in these sudden outbreaks of new disease — as in previous epidemics are method is to go directly to the area afflicted and collect data regarding patients’ actual clinical symptomology and disease progression. With this data we then proceed to determine the cause and mechanism of the disease. Only once we have carried out a thorough analysis of the disease mechanism do we establish a syndrome differentiation and treatment protocol.

We arrived in Wuhan on January 21 and in coordination with the National Health Bureau we were escorted directly to Jin-yin Lake Hospital (a hospital that exclusively treats infectious disease) where there was a relatively large number of hospitalized patients (with coronavirus). Once at the hospital we began a meticulous examination of patients’ symptomology disease progression tongue coating and pulse. On the first afternoon we probably examined over 60 patients including severe ICU cases and relatively stable patients in the general ward.

Having conducted a thorough examination and collected a substantial amount of data we then called a meeting with a team comprised of 6 experts from the Wuhan City Chinese Medical Hospital the Wuhan City Integrative Medicine Hospital and the Jin-yin Lake Hospital. We conducted an extended inquiry into the cause and location of disease as well as its mechanism and progression and combined our analysis with the recommendations of other experts from a number of top Wuhan Chinese Medicine hospitals. By 8:00pm we had formulated a tentative guideline which we then submitted to the National Administrative Bureau of Chinese Medicine. A national panel of experts convened in Beijing then carried out a second round of discussion and analysis and then drafted a preliminary protocol. This is the process that led to the publishing of the “Coronavirus Infection-Induced Pneumonia Treatment Protocol Version 3” Chinese Medicine treatment guideline.

Simultaneously we also separated patients at the Jin-yin Lake Hospital into two groups based on severity of illness and distributed two separate formulas to be prescribed for immediate use. We also formulated a vital energyhealthy qi promoting tea to be used by medical staff.

On January 22 we went to various other Chinese Medicine hospitals (Jin-yin Hospital was top priority because it was an infectious-disease hospital on day 2 they went to “general hospitals”) and designed treatment protocols for each medical team. We found that the patients in these hospitals with “suspected cases” of coronavirus had very similar symptomology to the Jin-yin Hospital patients. These Chinese Medical hospitals already had the infrastructure and expertise in place to treat the influx of Coronavirus patients with herbal medicine right away and from what we could gather it appeared that Chinese medical treatment proved to be effective and even superior (to what they had seen in the Jin-yin Hospital) in terms of stabilizing patients and bringing down fever.

I was very impressed even amazed by this interview and also by the level of commitment the Chinese government has shown in implementing Chinese medicine in response to the Coronavirus outbreak. They have their top minds working on this project and I think they are already showing some impressive results. It’s been a horrible few weeks for China but it’s also a great opportunity to show the world the incredible healing power and potential of this medicine in action.

A peculiar pattern is developing over the past two weeks. As we should know by now various countries are being hit by calamitous events almost simultaneously.

China Coronavirus Outbreak
Yesterday China has locked down the entire Wuhan City in an attempt of containing the further spread of a novel strain of the coronavirus which already claimed 26 deaths and 830 infections at the time of writing.

The timing of the incident is perfect as the Chinese population is about to celebrate their Lunar New Year of the Rat.

The US-China trade war has dragged on for 18 months before a partial trade agreement which when examined closely amounts to nothing in terms of China’s actual commitment to purchase US agricultural products.

But for Candidate Trump the media mileage is good enough to please his American heartland supporters for now.

The stock market however is not as enthusiastic as Trump.

Wuhan by the way is a transportation hub and capital city of the Hubei Province…

 Wuhan today is considered as the political economic financial commercial cultural and educational center of Central China.17 It is a major transportation hub with dozens of railways roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities.24 Because of its key role in domestic transportation Wuhan is sometimes referred to as “the Chicago of China” by foreign sources. –  Wikipedia

What an easy and efficient way would it be to spread an engineered virus that is patented by The Pirbright Institute (formerly the Institute for Animal Health) a “research institute in Surrey England dedicated to the study of infectious diseases of farm animals” all throughout a very large population through its transport system.

The institute forms part of the UK government’s Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC).

The Pirbright Institute’s funding comes from the UK government charities and pharmaceutical R&D outfits i.e. 25% of its income comes from a core grant from the BBSRC of around £11m about 50% comes from research grants from related government organisations such as DEFRA or industry and charities (such as the Wellcome Trust). The remaining 25% comes from direct payments for work carried out.

A similar bioweapon attack was done against China through the SARS virus purposely to eliminate the Asian genome on the face of the Earth. This was followed on through with the Tianjin nuclear blast in 2015.

Queen Liz has never been so happy about the Chinese leadership as shown here in the video. They hang their bankers too much like the Iranians.

Trump Ordered Gen. Soleimani’s Assassination After Inviting Him for Peace Talk
In a desperate move to win a second term Donald Trump did the unthinkable i.e. order the ambush of the most accomplished counterterrorism commander on the planet Gen. Qassem Soleimani.

The action should guarantee the full support of the entire Israel Lobby for his second presidential campaign through the already rigged electoral system.

Soleimani was responsible for organizing and plotting counter-ISISAl Qaeda operations using local militias in various places in the Middle East where the terrorists are operating.

Philippines’ 40-year Dormant Taal Volcano Erupts without Warning
Two weeks ago the long dormant picturesque Taal Volcano erupted without early warning and subsequently covered nearby towns and cities with volcanic ash. The volcano is just about 70 kilometers south of capital Manila in the middle of a lake.

On top of what the government can provide in terms of food and shelter those who can absorb evacuating families are doing their best to host some of the many thousands of evacuees fleeing from the catastrophe while the rest of the country are sending in much needed assistance.

The incumbent presidency of Mayor Rodrigo Duterte has been very consistent in uplifting the lives of the people through the elimination of income tax obligation for low income earners while tightening its grip on corruption at the Bureau of Customs and running after the tax-evading Oligarchy.

Just recently the president has ordered the review of all government contracts with private companies that are engaged in willful non-compliance of its stipulated commitments or to find out if the government is at the short end of the stick.

This has been triggered after two water concessionaires oligarchs Ayala and Pangilinan failed to deliver the minimum quality of service and the absence of water treatment facilities even when the consumers have already paid for them over the years that they were being billed for the service.

Moreover he persistently asserts the full independence of his foreign policy and the sovereignty of the nation.

On Friday individuals identified as a doctor employed by a Wuhan medical school and an administrative worker employed by a Wuhan hospital went to Queen Elizabeth Hospital on Gascoigne Road.  Both were suffering from fever and had reportedly travelled south to obtain medical attention after being unable to do so in China due to lack of medical resources.  

Front line medical staff at public hospitals voiced urgent concerns with regards to Hong Kongs current lack of restrictions when it comes to visitors from China.  This is because negative pressure isolation spaces in HK healthcare facilities  designed to effectively quarantine infected patients  had already gone over capacity - a situation which will lead to an ever-worsening crisis compromising safety of all patients who rely on hospital care.

Traduction de larticle ci-dessus sorti aujourdhui : 

Le nombre de morts du coronavirus de Wuhan en Chine continue daugmenter alors que les autorités et les travailleurs de la santé luttent pour contenir lépidémie.
Cinquante-six personnes ont été tuées par le nouveau coronavirus en Chine ont annoncé samedi des responsables de la santé. Plus de 1 900 cas confirmés ont été signalés à travers le pays.
Lagence de presse chinoise Xinhua a indiqué que 237 patients étaient dans un état critique.

Les travailleurs de la santé dans la ville chinoise de Wuhan disent que les hôpitaux manquent de fournitures car ils traitent un nombre croissant de patients.
Le gouvernement central chinois a annoncé quil enverrait plus de 1 200 agents de santé - ainsi que 135 personnels médicaux de lArmée populaire de libération - dans la ville dans un effort sans précédent pour contenir la propagation du virus.
Les célébrations du Nouvel An lunaire - la fête la plus importante du pays - ont été fortement affectées à Pékin Hong Kong et dans dautres grandes villes en raison du virus. Plus de 60 millions de personnes sont soumises à un verrouillage partiel dans les provinces du Hubei et du Guangdong.
Alors que la plupart des cas confirmés de virus se trouvent en Chine au moins 13 endroits en dehors de la Chine continentale dont la France lAustralie et les États-Unis signalent leurs premiers cas.
Au Canada les responsables de la santé ont annoncé samedi le premier cas positif présomptif de coronavirus. Laffaire attend une confirmation supplémentaire du laboratoire médical national du pays.

A Wuhan terre zéro du virus quatre professionnels de santé - dont des médecins - ont fait part à CNN des difficultés rencontrées par les équipes médicales sur le terrain. Ils ont demandé à rester anonymes pour éviter les répercussions.
Grâce à des conversations téléphoniques avec CNN et à des publications sur les réseaux sociaux chinois ils ont parlé des faibles ressources hospitalières. Dans les groupes privés en ligne les personnes identifiées comme membres du personnel hospitalier se coordonnent avec les membres du public pour importer des équipements de protection alors quils traitent un nombre croissant de patients infectés.
En termes de ressources lensemble de Wuhan fait défaut a déclaré par téléphone à CNN un travailleur de la santé basé à Wuhan. Cette personne a dit quelle recherchait davantage de vêtements de protection des lunettes de protection et des masques.
Cest vraiment comme si nous allions au combat à bout de bras a ajouté un travailleur de la santé utilisant un idiome chinois qui équivaut à partir au combat sans armure.
 Un membre du personnel de lhôpital affirme que les travailleurs de la santé ont recouru au port de couches pour travailler afin déviter davoir à retirer leurs combinaisons HAZMAT qui selon eux sont rares. Un médecin sur sa page Weibo sur les réseaux sociaux chinois a décrit des comptes similaires dans un autre hôpital de Wuhan.

Les membres de ma famille sont définitivement inquiets pour moi mais je dois encore travailler a expliqué un autre médecin. Mais elle a dit quelle espère quils obtiendront finalement léquipement dont ils ont besoin. Nos patrons nos fournisseurs dhôpitaux trouveront certainement un moyen de nous faire parvenir ces stocks a-t-elle ajouté.
Il nest pas clair si ces comptes sont anecdotiques ou sil y a des pénuries généralisées à Wuhan.
Les médias dÉtat chinois ont également partagé les messages de plusieurs hôpitaux de Wuhan dans lesquels ils demandent des dons publics de fournitures médicales. Ils rapportent quun membre du personnel de lhôpital a déclaré que les fournitures actuelles ne pouvaient durer que trois ou quatre jours.
La Commission de la santé de Wuhan a réquisitionné plus de 10 000 lits de 24 hôpitaux pour être utilisés dans le traitement des cas confirmés et suspects.
Vendredi les responsables de Wuhan ont reconnu que les hôpitaux locaux avaient du mal à accueillir les personnes recherchant des soins médicaux et ont déclaré que des mesures étaient mises en place pour atténuer la situation.
Les médias dÉtat ont également indiqué que la ville souhaitait construire une nouvelle installation de 25 000 mètres carrés (269 100 pieds carrés) dici une semaine augmentant ainsi la capacité hospitalière de 1 000 lits et que plusieurs centres médicaux de la province du Hubei demandent des dons de matériel médical.

Verrouiller le virus pendant la nouvelle année lunaire
Les autorités ont imposé des restrictions illimitées aux transports publics et aux voyages.
Tous les véhicules à moteur seront interdits dans le centre-ville de Wuhan à partir de dimanche pour contrôler

I am Chinese from Wuhan no one can leave the city or enter the city total cases here is 170 dead over 5000 infected
We cannot leave the city anymore we cannot allow others to enter the city the army is guarding all exit-entry point. All forms of mass transit are on lockdown including the airport they will let us all die here
Ive seen soldiers in full hazmat suits here in Hanyang from my second-floor apartment window they are spraying something fluid on the streets via large trucks using water cannons
USING VPN here it is not allowed to talk-criticize about the virus a jail sentence is sure if one does
Fang Zhong within the institute people are very very alarmed of what will happen to us
I know personally that at least two IOPCAS scientists have been put under house arrest the virus is not what the WEST thinks it is much more dangerous because it mutates from person to person at first slightly but could re-emerge under total different form within weeks
Our colleagues counted over 5000 cases within the city center as of yesterday at 1pm
They will never let us leave the city because the virus will spread within exponentially doubling every two days this is extremely contagious the virus stays in the air for 24 to 48 hours
People will panic the sun rises very soon most are unaware that the city is on total lockdown
In the Baofeng sector alone our colleagues counted 1400 cases many people have disappeared their loved ones searching for them in hospitals
I go to Central China University I am from Changsha
Do you have somewhere stocked with supplies where you can shelter in place for a few weeks (or months) where you can wait it out? Is your family trapped in the city with you?

No in China it is not possible cameras see everything we would be labeled as enemies and traitors we must stay put and wait from Central Party orders
There is panic and chaos in all are Wuhan hospitals people are disappearing with no trace and nobodies are found

I see people leaving in my apartment block light are starting to blink people are waking up and hearing the news my neighbor is leaving they say the roads are still free to get out of Wuhan I dont know but there will be huge traffic jams
The last planes are landing at the airport and the people dont know they wont be able to leave

The number that describes how many people a newly infected person is likely to pass a virus to is called R0 pronounced R naught (SN: 52819). SARS for instance had an R0 between two and five meaning that in a fully susceptible population an infected person could potentially spread the virus to two to five others. (Highly contagious measles in comparison has a R0 from 12 to 18.)

Estimates for the infectivity of the new virus range from the WHO’s estimate of 1.4 to 2.5 to a much bigger 3.6 to 4.0 calculation from Jonathan Read of Lancaster University in England and colleagues. Read’s group estimates that only about 5.1 percent of cases in Wuhan have been identified.

The patient is in good condition and is in isolation at a hospital Orange County health officials said. 
California has recorded its first confirmed case of the new strain of coronavirus brought to Orange County by a traveler who visited from the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan China.
The Orange County Health Care Agency confirmed late Saturday night that the infected persons virus was the same strain as the one that had spread to more than 2000 people in 14 countries and territories and caused 56 deaths since it was discovered late last month in central China. Two other cases have been diagnosed in the U.S. one in Washington state and one in Chicago.
The patient is in good condition and is in isolation at a hospital Orange County health officials said. Health authorities are following up with anyone who has had close contact with the patient but they noted that casual contact with an infected person — such as visiting the same grocery store or movie theater — only carries minimal risk of developing infection. 
The risk of local transmission remains low officials said. While officials were waiting to hear lab confirmation of the virus the patient was instructed on how to reduce exposing others to the virus.
Authorities also added there was no evidence that the virus had been spread by the traveler to other Orange County residents. 
The new strain of coronavirus known as 2019-nCoV can cause respiratory illness and pneumonia. It was originally thought only to be spreading from animals to people in central China but there are now indications it is also spreading among people. 
In people who are young and healthy the virus does not seem to cause severe illness with symptoms including fever coughing and shortness of breath. Most of the dozens of deaths tied to the coronavirus to date have been in the central Chinese province of Hubei of which Wuhan is the capital. 
Most of the dead were at least 50 years old with underlying medical problems or weakened immune systems Chinese officials said. But a 36-year-old man succumbed to the coronavirus last week and a healthcare worker also was reported to be among fatalities.
Health experts in the United States have said theres no evidence to suggest the new coronavirus is any more virulent than the flu.
“We don’t have evidence yet to suggest this is any more virulent than the flu you see in the U.S. each year” Michael Mina an epidemiology researcher at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health said last week. “Most people with proper medical attention will do just fine.”
But because this strain of coronavirus is new health officials are on high alert and researchers will have to start from square one in creating a vaccine which will probably take years to develop. 
Coronaviruses include a large variety of viruses — the common cold as well as those that caused the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). SARS and MERS sickened thousands of people around the world and caused hundreds of deaths. 
As of Friday 18 people between the ages of 3 to 58 had been tested for the virus in California according to the state Department of Public Health. They included a traveler who arrived at Los Angeles International Airport on a flight from Mexico City and was taken to a hospital early Thursday for an evaluation.
Dr. Sonia Angell director of the California Department of Public Health said in a video statement last week that the immediate health risk to the general public in California is low based on current information but that the department is carefully monitoring the virus and considers it “a serious public health concern.”
Besides the Orange County case only two other people have tested positive for the virus in the United States — a man in Washington state and a woman in Illinois.
Though the U.S. has not seen a major outbreak the virus has spread widely across Asia in the last month killing at least 56 people and sickening 2000 more in China according to officials there.
Chinas health minister said the country was entering a “crucial stage as “it seems like the ability of the virus to spread is getting stronger.
The pneumonia-like illnesses from the newly identified coronavirus first appeared last month in Wuhan an industrial and transportation hub in central China’s Hubei province. Other cases have been reported in Japan South Korea and Thailand. Singapore Vietnam and Hong Kong reported their first cases Thursday.
According to the Associated Press the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan will evacuate its personnel and some private citizens aboard a charter flight Tuesday. Wuhan has been under lockdown since Thursday with trains buses and airplane flights suspended.
Chinese travel agencies have been told to halt all group tours the state-owned English-language China Daily newspape

It is a mutated virus strain from SARS which also started in China years earlier.  It killed roughly 750 people before it went underground and dormant.  In that time it mutated as viruses do and were now dealing with its offspring.  I strongly believe that China is fudging on the numbers who are infected in their own country.  I put out a post as this virus exploded about 5 days ago with information on what you can do.

Personally Id stay away from big people areas....like airports subways train and bus stations.  I wouldnt go to a mall either.  Be smart about this.  Right now 3 confirmed cases of it in USA and roughly 50 other people in observation and their blood sent back to the CDC to confirm or not if they too have the coronavirus.  Stay tuned.  

My personal opinion?  Your best bet is to contact a Naturopathic Doctor (Google their directory online)  or Homeopath (National Center for Homeopathy has a directory for USACanada here.  Find the nearest one to you and call them on Monday.  http:www.homeopathycenter.orgprofessional-and-organizational-directory

...plus work with your primary physician who may or may not be open to alternative medicine.  My take on it is:  look at alternative medicine above for further helpsupport because there is nothing available right now to stop the virus if you contract it.  It is a virus not a bacteria and most antibiotics are directed at bacterial infection.  We only have a few VIRAL prescription medications.  You can talk to your MD about this further.  There is NO VACCINE available on this mutated form of SARS.  If you know of one let me know -).

My other advice which I follow myself is washing my hands with soap (real soap) and water after I have been to the grocery store or where ever theres groups of humans.

Chinese health authorities are struggling to deal with a skyrocketing rate of infection in the country of the new coronavirus with the number of cases increasing 50 percent in just 24 hours.

Chinas leader Xi Jinping has warned of an accelerating spread of the coronavirus adding to worries about the scope of a health crisis that has claimed at least 56 lives and triggered emergency health measures in cities across China.

More than 50 million people were ordered on lockdown in central China with a travel ban covering 16 cities in the central Hubei Province where the virus was first encountered. Here’s what we know:

?A third infection was announced in the United States a Chinese traveler from Wuhan. Infections have also been confirmed in France South Korea Japan Nepal Thailand Singapore Vietnam Taiwan and Australia. We’re mapping the spread here.

?The mayor of Wuhan the epicenter of the outbreak said he expects at least another 1000 cases of infection to surface.

?Health Minister Ma Xiaowei said Sunday that the transmissibility of the virus is increasing while the vice minister of industry Wang Jiangping said the country could not produce enough medical supplies to address demand.

?The sale of wild animals has been banned for the duration of the crisis. A wild animal market in Wuhan is widely seen as the epicenter of the current outbreak.

?Travel bans were extended in central China to put tens of millions of people effectively on local lockdowns. In Wuhan where the virus was first detected workers are racing to build at least three pop up 1000-bed hospitals. The situation is especially dire in the countryside where the medical infrastructure is poor. Beijing said there were no plans for a travel ban in the capital.

WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS | SCENES FROM CHINA’S DEADLY CORONAVIRUS CRISIS

BEIJING — Chinese health authorities are extending the holidays and deploying more than a thousand doctors and military personnel to the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak as the number of infections skyrocket and desperation grips the quarantined province of Hubei where more than 50 million people are stranded with a severe shortage of medical supplies.

The United States meanwhile announced a third case of the coronavirus — a Chinese traveler from Wuhan who took ill in Orange County Calif. Authorities say he is under care in isolation and the risk of local transmission is low.

In China however the rate of infection has been increasing daily with a 50 percent jump in cases on Sunday and local authorities expect a similar leap on Monday.

From www.reuters.com - January 24 10:39 PM
Gilead Sciences Inc said on Thursday it was assessing whether its experimental Ebola treatment could be used against the new coronavirus that has sickened hundreds of people in China and led to at least 18 deaths. “Gilead is in active discussions with researchers and clinicians in the United States and China regarding the ongoing Wuhan coronavirus outbreak and the potential use of remdesivir as an investigational treatment” a company spokesman said in an emailed statement. Dr. Anthony Fauci director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) told Reuters his agency was working with Gilead to test the company’s antiviral drug in people infected with the new coronavirus.
 
NIAID had previously tested remdesivir in patients with Ebola and found it to be ineffective. Fauci said there is some indication that it may work better against this new virus from China. Coronavirus infections can lead to respiratory illnesses some of which can be severe and deadly such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). They can also be much milder. The common cold is a strain of coronavirus.","100002510348878_VK_2929107973802968","huynh.vu.1967"

MANILA - Oil firms are set for another price rollback this week.

In separate announcements Chevron Cleanfuel Petro Gazz PTT Philippines Seaoil and Shell said they will reduce the prices of diesel by P0.40 per liter and gasoline by P0.30 per liter.

Chevron Seaoil and Shell will also slash kerosene prices by P0.35 per liter.

Most of the oil players will implement the rollback today.

This is the third consecutive week that oil firms reduced prices of diesel and kerosene and two straight weeks for gasoline price.

According to OilPrice.com WTI crude and Brent crude prices hit their lowest since late November last year.

As of this posting WTI crude traded at USD52.94 a barrel while Brent crude at USD58.61 a barrel lower than last week’s trading of USD54.54 per barrel and USD60.22 per barrel respectively.

Goldman Sachs also forecasted that the highly contagious coronavirus in China will ease global demand on jet fuel and will further soften world oil prices.

Some international airlines have temporarily cancelled flights to China due to the 2019 novel coronavirus.

Worries on the impact of the nCov resulted in the weakness of both the Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) and the peso yesterday.

The main equities index shed 0.47 percent or 35.78 points to 7587.63 points which BPI Research attributed to the concerns on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) after China reported more than 80 deaths from the epidemic that originated from Wuhan.

Several cases of 2019-nCoV have been reported in other countries like Japan South Korea Thailand Taiwan and the United States.

Philippine authorities have also reported they are currently monitoring 11 people suspected of having been infected by the virus.

With the risk-off sentiments most of the counters in the local bourse tracked the main index with the All Shares down by 0.62 percent or 28.23 points to 4495.34 points.

Industrial Holding Firms and Services lost 1.38 percent 0.71 percent and 0.67 percent respectively.

On the other hand Financials rose 0.22 percent Property 0.19 percent and Mining and Oil 0.10 percent.

Volume reached 1.90 billion shares amounting to P4.3 billion.

Losers led gainers at 119 to 69 while 43 shares were unchanged.

The local currency ended the week’s first trading day at 50.835 to a dollar from 50.815 on Friday.
It opened the day at 50.88 better than its 51.00 start in the previous session.

It traded between 50.94 and 50.8 resulting in an average of 50.872.

Volume totaled to USD787.95 million lower than the USD1.1 billion at the end of last week.

BPI Research forecasts the peso to trade between 50.70 and 50.10 to a greenback today.*PNA","318674540631_10162812259475632","visayandailystar"

If this applies to your sondaughter please contact us at school.

For those of you concerned about possible infection the Ministry of Health has provided practical information on their website which we encourage you to read - Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) guidance – Ministry of Health website 

https:www.health.govt.nznews-medianews-itemsnovel-coronavirus-update-24th-january-2020

Avoiding very close contact with people showing symptoms.

Frequently washing hands.

Avoiding close contact with sick live farm animals or wild animals.

Practicing cough etiquette (maintain distance cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing and wash hands).

Para José María Sumpsi catedrático de Economía y Política Agraria de la Universidad Politécnica de Madrid y ex empleado de FAO es inadmisible e intolerable que en un mundo con todos los adelantos tecnológicos mil millones de personas pasen hambre. Hay algo que no funciona. Jose Esquinas director de la cátedra de Estudios sobre Hambre y la Pobreza de la Universidad de Córdoba afirma que si las cosas no cambian nos vamos a cargar el planeta  ya no se trata de solidaridad sino de egoísmo inteligente...40.000 personas mueren a diario por desnutrición más que por cualquier peste.

The basketball legend and 13-year-old Gigi went to the 7am service at the Cathedral of Our Lady Queen of the Angels in Newport Beach. They both received Communion.

The father and daughter left the church and soon afterwards boarded the S-76 Sikorsky helicopter piloted by Ara Zobyan which was taking them to the Mamba Academy in Thousand Oaks for Gigis basketball practice.

The helicopter crashed into a hillside near Calabasas around 9.30am firefighters responded to a 911 call at 9.47am. Nine people perished on board.

A spokesman for Our Lady Queen of the Angels confirmed to DailyMail.com that Kobe was at the early morning service Sunday.

One parishioner who attended a later mass at the cathedral wrote on social media: During mass our priest informed us all that Kobe Bryant and his daughter attended mass this morning at the Cathedral of Our Lady Queen of the Angels.

Kobe Bryant and daughter Gigi attended Catholic mass at their local church hours before they both died in the tragic helicopter crash DailyMail.com can reveal
And Father David Barnes a Catholic priest in Boston Massachusetts also confirmed Kobes attendance.

He tweeted on Sunday: A friend texted me today to tell me that a friend of her’s (sic) saw KobeBryant at Catholic Mass this morning. Mass is the worship of God. Heaven is the worship of God. Go to Mass here so that you can worship God forever in heaven.

The service was conducted by Father Anthony Vu a Vietnamese parochial vicar at the church. Father Vu was ordained in 2009 and joined the Newport Beach church in 2018. Like Kobe Father Anthony spent his earlier years in Europe studying in the Catholic University of Louvain Belgium
In a moving Facebook post Bishop Timothy Freyer of the Orange Diocese who is currently in Rome meeting the Pope said Kobe was a committed Catholic who loved his faith.

He said: Our hearts remain heavy after the tragic loss suffered in the wake of yesterday’s helicopter crash in Calabasas.

We pray and mourn for the friends and family of the victims who have been publicly identified in news reports: Basketball icon Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna.

Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli and his wife Keri and daughter Alyssa.

Basketball coach Christina Mauser and pilot Ara Zobayan.

Kobe was a basketball icon who inspired us through his words and actions to set our goals work hard and achieve our dreams. 

He was a committed Catholic who loved his family and loved his faith.

A longtime Orange County resident and parishioner in our Diocese Kobe would frequently attend Mass and sit in the back of the church so that his presence would not distract people from focusing on Christ’s Presence.

Please join me in praying for the victims. May God grant their loved ones peace and bring them comfort during these difficult times.

And Los Angeles Archbishop Jose H Gomez said of Kobe on Twitter: So very sad to hear the news of KobeBryant’s tragic death this morning.

I am praying for him and his family. May he rest in peace and may our Blessed Mother Mary bring comfort to his loved ones. KobeBryantRIP.

There can be nothing more consoling to those who mourn than to know that

Avascular Necrosis Osteonecrosis

Avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis is the death of a segment of bone due to loss of blood supply. Both bone cells are the bone marrow are affected. AVN is a common cause of hip pain in young and middle aged patients between 35-50 years of age. It occurs more in males. AVN leads to severe degenerative arthritis of the hip joint and accounts for 10% of total hip replacement cases in the United States. The femoral head is the most common site of atraumatic AVN. The humeral head is the second most common area.

Bilateral AVN occurs in 80% of cases and each side may present at a different stage. Usually the physician will check the other hip x-rays even if non-symptomatic.

AdChoices
The exact etiology and process of AVN is not known. Interruption of the blood supply of the femoral head is a common pathway. Genetic factors may also be implicated as the cause of AVN. Early diagnosis detects early stages of AVN that can be helped by a head preserving procedure such as decompression bone graft or vascularized fibular graft.

With multifocal osteonecrosis three or more sites occur in about 3% of patients. It can affect the hip knee shoulder or ankle. Patients with osteonecrosis at a different site than the hip should undergo an MRI of the hip to rule out asymptomatic osteonecrosis of the hip.

X-rays are initially normal. MRI is the best study when the x-ray is normal and AVN is considered or suspected. The AVN is seen on the anterosuperior aspect of the femoral head.
Trauma such as hip fracture or dislocation can cause AVN. The most common causes of AVN are steroid use alcohol gout metabolic and genetic problems. The condition may be associated with a hypercoagulability state such as decrease in Protein S Protein C and Factor V Leiden (we routinely get that study with AVN cases).

AdChoices
The condition may also be idiopathic (without a cause) and then AVN is a diagnosis of exclusion.
If the Frag lateral x-ray of the hip shows a crescent sign it means that osteonecrosis is present and probably advanced.

2016-08-19-1471628147-9928400-AVN3.PNG

Double density on MRI is pathognomonic for AVN. The patient may be asymptomatic and may present with dull hip pain (anterior groin pain) or severe arthritis pain due to collapse of the joint. With early arthritis the patient will have a decrease in the internal rotation of the hip. On the x-ray the patient will have a flattened contour with a collapse of the femoral head and decreased joint space. If the joint surface is intact without collapse core decompression or vascularized bone graft is helpful. If the joint is collapsed arthroplasty is the procedure of choice and rarely an osteotomy is done.

Bisphosphonates are used in early stages of AVN. It prevents femoral head collapse however the results are controversial.

2016-08-19-1471628187-5055232-AVN4.PNG

Rule out other causes of hip pain such as gout PVNS femoral inguinal hernia rheumatoid arthritis or stress fracture of the femoral neck.

Story: https:7news.link2uA1MB3

NSW Health Statement: With students returning to school next week parents of children who have had contact with a confirmed case of novel Coronavirus are being urged to keep their children at home and monitor for symptoms. NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant explained that any child who has been in contact with a person confirmed as having novel coronavirus must not attend school or childcare for 14 days after the last contact with the infected person. “14 days represents the internationally recognised incubation period for the disease” Dr Chant said. “After this time the child is considered not to be at risk of infection.” Students who have travelled to Wuhan and Hubei during the school holidays can return to school but should be carefully monitored for symptoms of coronavirus infection. “The most common symptom is a fever” Dr Chant said. “Other symptoms include cough sore throat and shortness of breath.” Anyone who exhibits these symptoms should be isolated immediately from other people and seek medical attention as soon as possible. If you develop a fever a cough sore throat or shortness of breath within 14 days of travel to Hubei or contact with a person with confirmed coronavirus you should immediately isolate yourself from other people. Contact your GP or your emergency department or call the healthdirect helpline 1800 022 222 and seek medical attention as soon as possible. Minister for Health Brad Hazzard explained that NSW Health has processes in place to identify any close contacts of cases confirmed in Australia. “Advice about not attending school would be provided to these close contacts” he said. There are currently four confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in NSW. All cases had travelled to Wuhan China or had contact with a confirmed case in China. Parents with concerns can contact their local Public Health Unit on 1300 066 055 for advice or visit the dedicated NSW Health information page at https:www.health.nsw.gov.au…diseas…Pagescoronavirus.as NSW Department of Education has issued guidance to all NSW Schools which included information to guide school staff in the event of a child becoming sick.?

Following the confirmation of a second presumptive case of coronavirus in Toronto Ontario health officials are currently investigating up to 21 other individuals who may have the illness.

UPDATE: Province currently isolating and awaiting test results for 19 people for possible coronavirus infection alongside two confirmed cases https:t.coIVhYQZPunw pic.twitter.comnhJSNkvYQt

— CP24 (CP24) January 27 2020

Provincial officials said in a press conference earlier today that 19 people are currently under watch for potential infection while the National Post reports this number to be 21 according to a private source.

Staff from Toronto Public Health are also seeking a number of passengers who were on China Southern Airlines flight CZ311 which flew from Guangzhou to Toronto on January 22 after the citys first confirmed case of the novel virus turned out to be a man who traveled in on that plane.

The mans wife is currently presumed to be Torontos second case.

So far 36 people contacted the public health officials who thought they had the virus. 1 is confirmed. Another is presumed. 15 are cleared (they do not have the virus). The last 19 are still waiting for their results and all 19 were from Wuhan.

Fifteen additional individuals in Ontario who were previously suspected to possibly have 2019-nCoV have since been cleared as the other 19-21 await lab test results.

Many of those under observation are currently in isolation at Toronto-area hospitals CP24 reports.

T?n? koutou

As you will have seen in the media the situation is rapidly evolving internationally concerning the coronavirus.
 
This is a new virus and its specific nature is currently unclear however it appears that you can have the virus at an early stage and not be showing any symptoms.  This incubation period is currently considered to be 14 days. 
 
Children and young people are currently returning to classrooms.  The health of students and staff is a priority for all.  I encourage you to err on the side of caution and here are some steps you can take.
As always anyone who is unwell should not be at school or at their early learning service. If you have a particular concern about any child student or staff member please urge parents or the staff member to contact Healthline at 0800 611 116 or their GP for medical advice. Healthline has translators and interpreters available 247 in 150 languages and they do have Mandarin and Cantonese speaking staff available.
 
If a student still attends school while showing symptoms the Principal of a state school can preclude them if they believe on reasonable grounds they may have a communicable disease (Section 19 Education Act). The student has to stay away for the infectious period of the specific disease. For private schools Section 19 of the Education Act does not apply.  Principals can request that a student with an infectious disease or is suspected of having an infectious disease does not attend.
 
You can request that a staff member with an infectious disease or is suspected of having an infectious disease does not attend.
 
For any staff member or student who may be at high risk of exposure because they have recently been to China or have been in close contact with someone confirmed with the virus I encourage you to ask that the staff member or parentcaregiver of the student delay the start of their school year for 14 days and voluntarily stay away.
 
If you haven’t already done so you need to contact your parent communities to share this and any relevant information. Please keep an eye on our website as we will be updating this as new information is received.

Der khazarianische Mob benutzt Virus-Angst-Pornos in einem verzweifelten Versuch die Kontrolle über seine über 200 Nationalstaaten zu behalten

Teil 1 übersetzt von max

Der khazarianische Mob kämpft um sein Leben und schürt die Pandemie-Angst in einem verzweifelten Versuch die Kontrolle über die Menschheit zu behalten sagen mehrere Quellen. Dies geschieht weil sie eine (vorübergehend bis in den Februar verlängerte) Zahlungsfrist für die Corporation der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika nicht einhalten können sagen die an den Verhandlungen beteiligten Quellen. Eines der Ziele der Verhandlungen ist die Wiederherstellung der Souveränität des Volkes und der Republik der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika. Dies werde auch zur Enthüllung des geheimen Weltraumprogramms führen fügen sie hinzu.

Wir werden später weiter darüber sprechen aber lassen Sie uns zunächst einen Blick auf den pandemischen Überlebensgag der Kabalen werfen. Wie die meisten unserer Leser wahrscheinlich bereits wissen ist es höchst unwahrscheinlich dass der Ausbruch des Coronavirus in China ein natürliches Ereignis war. Es gibt viele Anzeichen dafür dass diese Pandemie im Voraus geplant war um Geld von China für die US-Corporation zu erpressen.

Zunächst einmal gab es einen systematischen Angriff auf alle Internetseiten die von den Propagandamedien der Unternehmen unterdrückte Nachrichten anbieten. Zum Beispiel wurde Natural News mit seiner langen Geschichte der Aufdeckung von Skandalen im Zusammenhang mit Impfstoffen geschlossen. Auch Jimstone Freelance wurde härter getroffen als sonst.

Auch unsere Seite ist stark angegriffen worden. Unser ehemaliger Webmaster verlor plötzlich den Verstand und zeigte Anzeichen einer schweren PCP-Vergiftung.  Jetzt hat er Selbstmord begangen.  Danach wurden wir von unserer eigenen Website ausgeschlossen bis uns die weißen Hüte in der NSA bei der Wiederherstellung halfen. Wir haben auch unter ernsthaften finanziellen Angriffen zu leiden.

Diese Angriffe kamen kurz vor dem Ausbruch der Coronavirus-Pandemie und wurden in den Unternehmensmedien mit sensationeller Angstmacherei und Übersättigung behandelt. Neben der Erpressung scheint dies ein Versuch zu sein Angst und Hass wieder als das kontrollierende Narrativ unseres öffentlichen Diskurses einzuführen.

Es sieht so aus als hätten sie es am 18. Oktober 2019 geprobt als in den USA eine große Übung stattfand bei der eine Pandemie und der daraus resultierende wirtschaftliche Zusammenbruch simuliert wurde. Die Sponsoren dieser Veranstaltung waren das Weltwirtschaftsforum (Davos) die Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation und die Bloomberg School of Public Health an der John Hopkins University.  Mit anderen Worten: Das Zentrum der Kabale. Als das Weltwirtschaftsforum dann vom 21. bis 24. Januar 2020 seine Jahrestagung in Davos abhielt brach eine echte Pandemie aus und erhielt eine gesättigte Publicity.

Wenn es sich jedoch um ein Komplott handelt dann geht es ihnen ins Gesicht weil alternative Nachrichtenseiten wie Prepare for Change einige der massiven Beweise vorlegen die zeigen dass die US-Unternehmensregierung seit dem Wahldiebstahl durch George Bush Jr. im Jahr 2000 Bio-Waffen herstellt und verbreitet.  Denken Sie daran dass dies die Leute sind die sagten eine ethnisch-spezifische Biowaffe wäre ein nützliches politisches Werkzeug.

Der britische Geheimdienst berichtet uns dass sie hören es handele sich um einen Lungenentzündungsvirus der aus einem schlecht geführten Biolabor hervorgegangen ist.

Die folgende Erklärung wurde von den asiatischen Geheimbünden einschließlich der 55 Millionen Mitglieder der Hongmen und der Blue Dragon Society mit ihren vielen Millionen Mitgliedern herausgegeben:

Wenn dieser Virus künstlich ist oder im Rahmen eines Angriffsplans freigesetzt wurde und kein natürlicher Virus ist dann schwören wir die Hongmen der größte Geheimbund Asiens zusammen mit der eisengebundenen geheimen Blue Society dass wir den Feind mit Sicherheit zur Strecke bringen ihn bis ans Ende der Welt jagen und dafür sorgen werden dass kein einziges ihrer Haare auf diesem Planeten zurückbleibt.

???Dr. Yuen Kwok Yung a highly respected doctor during the previous SARS period gave the following advice in a speech yesterday. 
1. If going on a flight make sure you wear a mask. 
2. Always have antiseptic cleanser or towel readily available.
3. The virus “Coronavirus” is similar type of virus like the previous SARS or MERS. This time it is OC43. There is still no known method of tackling this virus. 
4. If you have to go to the market make sure you wear a mask. Be very vigilant.
5. Health Authority announced that this virus is very serious. However  as the virus is found to be able to enter your body if your throat or throat mucous is dry the one precaution they suggest which can be taken is to ensure your throat or throat mucous is always in a moist condition. In fact they suggest not to allow your throat to become dry as in 10 minutes of being dry the virus will find ways to enter into your body. So do not refrain from drinking water always have a bottle handy. 
For adults they suggest drinking 50-80cc of warm water for children 30-50cc. Just drink if you feel your throat is dry. Do not hesitate. However drinking more than the amount recommended is not necessary as it will just want to pass through your system. The idea is to “Keep your Throat Constantly Moist”
6. Before end of March try not to enter crowded places MTR or public Transport and wear a mask if necessary. 
7. Avoid eating too much deep fried food and take plenty of Vitamen C. 
8. Control Centre advice on symptoms of this virus:
- fast and high fever hard to lower but if successful the fever will return very soon. 
- next stage is coughing in long duration people affected are mainly children.
- Adults has mainly throat symptoms together with headaches and physical discomforts.
- the virus is “highly” contagious. 
- elderly and young children are most susceptible so take super precaution.
Pls be safe. God Bless you all.","100025713574319_555467188653729","heshan.heshstyle"

MarketWatch.com – Top Stories

U.S. stocks are heading toward their biggest one-day losses in several months as the coronavirus spreads from China.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average              DJIA -1.30%            and the S&P 500              SPX -1.29%           each fell as much as 1.9% and the Nasdaq Composite Index              COMP -1.55%           tumbled as much as 2.5%.

Jefferies’ global head of microstrategy Desh Peramunetilleke said momentum stocks would be hit hard as the deadly virus caused the market to “take a breather.” Momentum stocks certainly reflected the fear with a number of semiconductor stocks down big. Airlines and other travel-related names also slumped.

Mark DeCambre reviewed the history of stock-market reaction to previous epidemics around the world.

Energy stocks were among the hardest-hit as West Texas crude oil for March delivery              CLH20 -2.09%            dropped 2.5% to $52.86 a barrel. Meanwhile gold headed toward a six-year high.

8 Questions & Answers 
By Dr. Wang Huan

1) Is the new coronavirus pneumonia curable?
 
On January 24 2020 two top international medical journals The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine published Chinese doctors and scientists experiences in the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus pneumonia. From the case summary the ability of this new virus to cause disease is lower than that of SARS in 2003.
 
New coronavirus pneumonia cases were first found in late December 2019 in Wuhan. More than 30 critically ill patients have been cured. Most patients with less severe symptoms were not hospitalized and were isolated at home where they improved and recovered.
 

Therefore as long as most patients do not have a secondary infection or other medical issues recovery can occur within 2-4 weeks.

 2) How to protect yourself?

In an interview by Zhong Nanshan the most authoritative respiratory expert from the National Academy of Engineering:

Pay attention to protect yourself but dont panic. 
Minimize visits to relatives and friends avoid crowded places as much as possible wear masks when going out pay attention to indoor ventilation and wash hands frequently.
 Avoid staying up late.

Wear a mask or cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or clothing when coughing or sneezing to reduce the spread of the virus. 

3) How can I tell if I have the new coronavirus pneumonia? 

Are there any specific symptoms to look for?

You cannot judge if you have this new coronavirus by yourself. Fever (some patients have no fever at the beginning of the illness) is a characteristic symptom of the new coronavirus pneumonia. This can be accompanied by a mild dry cough fatigue poor breathing or diarrhea. Once these symptoms appear further diagnosis is needed at the hospital.

4) Should I go to the hospital as soon as I get a fever? 

What is considered a mild illness?

Not all fever patients need to go to the hospital immediately.

Fever below 38°C with no difficulty breathing can be regarded as mild.
For patients with mild symptoms home isolation with oral over the counter medications can usually control the condition. It is not recommended that patients with mild symptoms go to the hospital repeatedly. This is due to potentially increasing cross-infection and exposing yourself to patients experiencing more severe symptoms.
In addition quarantined hospital patients are not allowed visitors.
Patients with symptoms can call a doctor from home to determine their condition and receive health guidance before deciding whether to go to a designated hospital to avoid cross-infection.*
If symptoms such as fever cough and difficulty breathing worsen take protective measures to see a designated hospital in time.

5) Why is it recommended to treat patients with mild symptoms at home?

Because there is no specific medicine for this new coronavirus infectious pneumonia and symptomatic supportive care is the main treatment. 

Oral medications (fever reducers cough medicines etc.) have the same treatment effect as injections in the hospital and good rest and nutrition can be done at home.

 6) If I need home isolation how do I choose an isolation location?

 

If you have access to multiple places it’s preferable to isolate yourself at one location.

Patients should be isolated to a single room with the door kept closed. The bathroom should not be shared with others to avoid contact with the patient’s bodily fluids.

Stay warm. If in isolation there is no need to keep windows open for long periods of time. 

  7) What are recommended diet and activities for patients in isolation at home?

 

Ensure adequate rest don’t stay up late and do not panic.

Drink plenty of water or chicken soupbroth. This is good for improving immunity.  

Eat more fruits and vegetables to achieve a balanced diet.

8) Some current myths circulating about the new coronavirus pneumonia.

Garlic water can treat the new coronavirus pneumonia. FALSE.

Drinking garlic water is neither a physical barrier like a mask nor a nutritional preventative.
 
Eating strawberries can prevent new coronavirus pneumonia. FALSE.

Strawberries can be part of a balanced diet but it is not possible for it or any other specific food to inhibit or prevent the new coronavirus.

???? (F?ng yóu j?ng néng - Wind Oil Essential Balm) can prevent the new coronavirus pneumonia.  FALSE. 

The main ingredients of Wind Oil Essential Balm are menthol methyl salicylate (holly oil) camphor eugenol and eucalyptus oil. None of its main ingredients has been proven to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. In addition methyl salicylate is toxic and if taken orally can cause poisoning. For children taking more than 4 ml can be fatal.
 

A vaccine against the new coronavirus pneumonia is out! FALSE.

 

There is no authoritative report about the successful development of a new coronavirus pneumonia vaccine. Regarding

Seafarers Face Screening in China Singapore amid Coronavirus Outbreak
Seafarers calling at Chinese ports are advised to wear masks and take precautionary measures to avoid getting infected with a new coronavirus and prevent its potential spreading.

When entering Chinese ports seafarers are expected to remain on board their ships and disembark their vessels only where absolutely necessary.

The local authorities are requiring all vessels to report the temperature and condition of vessel’s crew before entry into the port the London P&I Club said citing its correspondents.

Ships’ crews are also advised to alert the authorities in the event coronavirus is suspected on board and take precautions to reduce the possibility of the spread of any virus including minimal interpersonal exchanges with people from ashore avoiding contact with people who show symptoms of flu or high temperature and taking care of personal hygiene including more frequent handwashing etc.

The warnings are being issued as the coronavirus outbreak stemming from the inland city Wuhan Hubei province has spread to some of China’s port cities such as Shanghai Guangzhou Shenzhen and Tianjin. Wuhan city which is a major domestic and international transport hub has been quarantined with its bus rail air and ship transport shut down.

The virus outbreak coincides with the Chinese New Year in the last week of January when large population movements from China are expected.

As such additional cases have been identified in a growing number of countries internationally such as South Korea Japan Taiwan Thailand and Singapore as well as one case in the United States. Initial estimates indicate that more than 600 people have contracted the virus and at least 17 people have died.

As a response the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) has implemented temperature screening at all sea checkpoints including ferry and cruise terminals PSA Terminals and Jurong Port for inbound travellers from January 24 2020.

“Travellers and ship crew arriving at sea checkpoints will undergo temperature screening conducted by on-site healthcare assistants. Suspect cases will be referred to the hospitals for further assessment” the MPA said.

“MPA has put up health advisories at the sea checkpoints to advise travellers and ship crew on the precautionary measures to take when travelling as well as to remain vigilant and adopt good hygiene practices at all times.”

Kuwait’s hub for the export of crude products and gas Mina Al Ahmadi Port Authority has advised that vessels coming directlylast porttransiting from China are requested to provide a statement declaring if any crew onboard has a high temperature sore throat coughing or breathing difficulties.

“Upon arrival such vessels must drop anchor at the Out of Port Limits Anchorage. The Port Medical Officer (PMO) will board to check crew for any of the above symptoms before clearing the vessel for berthing and other operations.

“These vessels will not be allowed to have shore leave disembarkation for off signers supply of provisionbond stores or any other service provided until cleared by Quarantine (PMO) Authorities” GAC said.

The medical checks and screening of ships across the board are likely to cause delays and disruption to ships’ itineraries.

Things to know
Typical symptoms of the coronavirus include fever cough difficulty in breathing and fatigue.

Since it has been confirmed that the virus can be passed from person to person relevant medical and quarantine authorities in China are highly alerted to control and supervise any suspected cases.

According to an advisory issued by Oasis P&I Services Company Limited in case a crewmember is showing the typical symptoms on board and would like to disembark to see a doctor it is very likely that additional checks and precautionary measures will be conducted by quarantine officers.

In case any suspected case of coronavirus is found on board the ship should report to the owners immediately and arrange to seek professional medical assistance from ashore for the affected crewmember as early as possible.

At the same time proper prevention and separation measures should be taken to avoid contact with other crewmembers to reduce the possibility of any virus being spread.

Furthermore owners are required to report such cases to local quarantine authorities under relevant laws.

Impact on the tanker market
The latest outbreak is expected to cause some headwinds on the oil market and slow down China’s oil imports.

China is the world’s largest oil importer with more than 10 Mbd of crude oil being imported.

“Any impact on ChineseAsian oil demand is likely to be much more significant not only in volume terms but also in terms of oil import flows and the ripple effect on the tanker market” Poten & Partners said in its tanker opinion.

Der khazarianische Mob benutzt Virus-Angst-Pornos in einem verzweifelten Versuch die Kontrolle über seine über 200 Nationalstaaten zu behalten

Teil 1 übersetzt von max

Der khazarianische Mob kämpft um sein Leben und schürt die Pandemie-Angst in einem verzweifelten Versuch die Kontrolle über die Menschheit zu behalten sagen mehrere Quellen. Dies geschieht weil sie eine (vorübergehend bis in den Februar verlängerte) Zahlungsfrist für die Corporation der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika nicht einhalten können sagen die an den Verhandlungen beteiligten Quellen. Eines der Ziele der Verhandlungen ist die Wiederherstellung der Souveränität des Volkes und der Republik der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika. Dies werde auch zur Enthüllung des geheimen Weltraumprogramms führen fügen sie hinzu.

Wir werden später weiter darüber sprechen aber lassen Sie uns zunächst einen Blick auf den pandemischen Überlebensgag der Kabalen werfen. Wie die meisten unserer Leser wahrscheinlich bereits wissen ist es höchst unwahrscheinlich dass der Ausbruch des Coronavirus in China ein natürliches Ereignis war. Es gibt viele Anzeichen dafür dass diese Pandemie im Voraus geplant war um Geld von China für die US-Corporation zu erpressen.

Zunächst einmal gab es einen systematischen Angriff auf alle Internetseiten die von den Propagandamedien der Unternehmen unterdrückte Nachrichten anbieten. Zum Beispiel wurde Natural News mit seiner langen Geschichte der Aufdeckung von Skandalen im Zusammenhang mit Impfstoffen geschlossen. Auch Jimstone Freelance wurde härter getroffen als sonst. Andere Journalisten werden mit gefälschten Strafanzeigen bedroht.

Danach wurden wir von unserer eigenen Website ausgeschlossen bis uns die weißen Hüte in der NSA bei der Wiederherstellung halfen. Wir haben auch unter ernsthaften finanziellen Angriffen zu leiden.

Diese Angriffe kamen kurz vor dem Ausbruch der Coronavirus-Pandemie und wurden in den Unternehmensmedien mit sensationeller Angstmacherei und Übersättigung behandelt. Neben der Erpressung scheint dies ein Versuch zu sein Angst und Hass wieder als das kontrollierende Narrativ unseres öffentlichen Diskurses einzuführen.

I was very impressed even amazed by this interview and also by the level of commitment the Chinese government has shown in implementing Chinese medicine in response to the Coronavirus outbreak. They have their top minds working on this project and I think they are already showing some impressive results. Its been a horrible few weeks for China but its also a great opportunity to show the world the incredible healing power and potential of this medicine in action. I translated the whole interview below please feel free to pass it along assign to students etc. Italicized portions are my (the translators) notes.

An Interview with Liu Qing-quan a Chinese Medical physician and scholar who lead a nationwide team of Chinese medical experts in designing a treatment protocol for Wuhan Coronavirus.
(Chinese version originally published in “Health Report” (???) by journalist Wang Ning (??) http:mini.eastday.coma200126020132257.html)

On January 21 Beijing Chinese Medical Hospital Chief Liu Qing-quan and China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Guang-an-men Hospital Emergency Department Chief Qi Wen-sheng arrived in Wu-han as part of the first delegation of Chinese Medical Specialists appointed by the National Administrative Bureau of Chinese Medicine and the National Health Bureau to take part in the frontline battle against Coronavirus.

These two specialists have now returned to Beijing. In an exclusive interview this morning Health Daily journalist Wang Ning sat down and spoke with Liu Qing-quan about his experience in Wu-han.

We should note that in 2003 during the SARS epidemic Liu Qing-quan was among the first to begin treating patients in epidemic-afflicted areas. He led a team of doctors saving patients and learning as he went. He also was part of a team of specialists that drafted an integrative medicine guideline for treatment. His work was instrumental in limiting and controlling the spread of SARS.

The following content has been adapted from a recording of our interview with Hospital Chief Liu Qing-quan.

How was the Chinese Medical treatment protocol formulated?

The four methods of diagnosis (observation auscultation and olfaction interrogation and pulse feeling) are central to Chinese medical diagnosis and treatment and to some degree they are even more important in these sudden outbreaks of new disease — as in previous epidemics are method is to go directly to the area afflicted and collect data regarding patients’ actual clinical symptomology and disease progression. With this data we then proceed to determine the cause and mechanism of the disease. Only once we have carried out a thorough analysis of the disease mechanism do we establish a syndrome differentiation and treatment protocol.

We arrived in Wuhan on January 21 and in coordination with the National Health Bureau we were escorted directly to Jin-yin Lake Hospital (a hospital that exclusively treats infectious disease) where there was a relatively large number of hospitalized patients (with coronavirus). Once at the hospital we began a meticulous examination of patients’ symptomology disease progression tongue coating and pulse. On the first afternoon we probably examined over 60 patients including severe ICU cases and relatively stable patients in the general ward.

Having conducted a thorough examination and collected a substantial amount of data we then called a meeting with a team comprised of 6 experts from the Wuhan City Chinese Medical Hospital the Wuhan City Integrative Medicine Hospital and the Jin-yin Lake Hospital of Chinese Medicine. We conducted an extended inquiry into the cause and location of disease as well as its mechanism and progression and combined our analysis with the recommendations of other experts from a number of top Wuhan Chinese Medicine hospitals. By 8:00pm we had formulated a tentative guideline which we then submitted to the National Administrative Bureau of Chinese Medicine. A national panel of experts convened in Beijing then carried out a second round of discussion and analysis and then drafted a preliminary protocol. This is the process that led to the publishing of the “Coronavirus Infection-Induced Pneumonia Treatment Protocol Version 3” Chinese Medicine treatment guideline.

Simultaneously we also separated patients at the Jin-yin Lake Hospital into two groups based on severity of illness and distributed two separate formulas to be prescribed for immediate use. We also formulated a vital energyhealthy qi promoting tea to be used by medical staff.

On January 22 we went to various other Chinese Medicine hospitals (Jin-yin Hospital was top priority because it was an infectious-disease hospital on day 2 they went to “general hospitals”) and designed treatment protocols for each medical team. We found that the pa

THANKFUL FOR SAIGON MALL in 
Halt?m City.  David Dang owner of Nguyen Loi oriental supermarket? had an elaborate celebration yesterday with Dragon Dance candy treats handed out and fireworks.  

Grateful Mr. Dang wants to invest highly in Haltom by building a beautiful cultural experience that will enhance a desperately needed update to the Denton HighwayBelknap corridor.  He plans artwork and an amazing entry to offer a center which will draw more interest into Haltom City especially on weekends.

I took my granddaughter yesterday to the New Year celebration.  Mayor Dr. Troung was gracious enough to share red envelopes with us to hand out to the children watching the Dragon Dance.  These traditional gifts hold money and always bring a smile.  We greeted each one with “Happy New Year” in Vietnamese to grateful receivers.  My granddaughter thought this was so much fun to point out children to give to. 

We noticed different languages spoken and people from all backgrounds there.  It was a much more diverse crowd than last year’s celebration. That was so encouraging to see.

On a sidenote we saw many people wearing a protective mask because of the coronavirus threat. In one picture below you can see even dancers had them on.?  We are praying and believing this virus will be contained. 

NOTE: The city Council meeting tonight has the plans for Mr. Dang’s new project on the agenda. Please turn out to support cultural diversity renovation and a landmark to draw others to Haltom City ??with classic Asian products and many other services.  We met people from Irving and Cleburne who drive here every weekend to shop at the market after church.  For commuters to have a reason to return stop and shop Haltom can only be good for our economy and public perception.  We want everyone to love and see the growth and value of our city as we do. 

We picked up eggrolls from Vinh Binh to take home and celebrate the day.  Thankful for investments enhancements and the opportunities being brought to lift up...

One of the patients a five-year-old Chinese boy from Wuhan was discharged from the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC) Friday evening Jan. 24 shortly after he was cleared of the 2019-nCoV infection by laboratory test results from the Victoria Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Melbourne Australia.

But the 10 others are still confined in various hospitals across the country including two more cases in Cebu the DOH national report said.

Duque in a broadcast aired by Radio-TV Malacañang said an 18-year-old girl is still in isolation at the VSMMC while a 61-year-old woman is at the Allied Care Experts (ACE) Medical Center both located in Cebu City.

Aside from these two cases there are three patients under investigation (PUIs) in Kalibo Aklan one in Tacloban City Leyte two in Metro Manila one in Palawan and one in Camiguin.

Duque said the PUIs are Chinese Brazilian American and German nationals with a history of travel to Wuhan City in China ground zero of the 2019-nCoV outbreak.

Interviewed by SunStar Cebu DOH 7 Director Jaime Bernadas confirmed the confinement of the 18-year-old girl but said he has not received information about a 61-year-old woman.

“We have an 18-year-old girl at the VSMMC but she’s not under investigation. She is classified under suspected case” Bernadas said.

Bernadas explained that persons classified under suspected case are those that have travel histories to China particularly Wuhan in the past two weeks and have manifested signs of respiratory illness such as fever cough and colds while PUIs are those with a high suspicion level for the 2019-nCoV and need confirmation from the lab in Australia.

Dr. Luisito Co ACE Medical Center director for his part belied Duque’s report of an elderly woman admitted to their hospital.

“Please be informed that ACE Medical Center Cebu is not yet operational. We are on the process of getting our full occupancy permit from the (Cebu) City Hall. We have no admitted patients yet” Co told SunStar Cebu in a text message.

As of Monday afternoon Bernadas said there are four Chinese nationals tagged as suspected cases in Central Visayas.

Three of these patients including the 18-year-old girl are in Cebu City while the other patient is in Bohol.

Bernadas begged off from disclosing details on the other two patients in Cebu City to protect their privacy.

“They are already cleared of any respiratory illness but we’re just waiting for the results from the RITM (Research Institute for Tropical Medicine)” Bernadas said in a mix of Cebuano and English.

As this developed a message spread across Facebook claimed that five Chinese nationals from Wuhan arrived at the emergency room of Cebu Doctors’ University Hospital in Cebu City and were isolated.

Bernadas said there was no such incident recorded by the DOH 7.

In an advisory issued last night DOH reiterated that to date there are no confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines.

“DOH also calls on the public to be responsible and refrain from sharing unverified information” said the DOH advisory posted on Facebook.

DOH assured that it is “on top of the issue and will regularly update the public through its official channels.”

As more and more people have taken to wearing surgical masks to prevent the spread of viruses local pharmacies and stores have run out of the protective gear.

Bernadas advised that if masks are no longer available commercially the public can sew their own using cloths handkerchiefs or face towels.

The public is also advised to practice frequent handwashing avoid unprotected contact with farm or wild animals practice proper cough etiquette avoid close contact with people showing cold or flu-like symptoms and ensure that food is well cooked.

Other reactions

Gov. Gwendolyn Garcia has met with officials of the Provincial Health Office DOH 7 Bureau of Quarantine port authorities and major hospitals in the province.

The governor said results of their closed door meeting will be the bases for an executive order (EO) which will be issued on measures to guard against coronavirus.

Just like the EO she issued against the African swine fever Garcia said the coronavirus measure will also be backed up by a provincial ordinance.

“That much I can give you as of the moment because I need to proceed with this in a most cautious and deliberate manner” she continued.

The governor will meet again with these agencies and Chinese Consul General Jia Li at the Capitol on Thursday Jan. 30. She also invited the Bureau of Immigration Cebu Alliance of Tour Operations Specialists Philippine Coast Guard and the Philippine National Police to the next meeting.

Nepal offers to be a mediator between India and Pakistan to resolve the issues

Nepal offered to play the role of a mediator between India and Pakistan to resolve any problem. The country said that it is important for the two countries to have a dialogue to resolve their issues. Nepal also stated that if necessary it plays the role of a mediator too. Nepals initiation to resolve issues between India and Pakistan comes as India has been distancing itself from the SAARC in the last three years.

Nepals concern-SAARC summit:
The move by Nepal comes due to the uncertainty prevailing over the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit. The last SAARC Summit in 2014 was held in Kathmandu Nepal. It was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The 2016 SAARC summit was scheduled to be held in Islamabad. But after the terrorist attack on an Indian Army camp in Uri in J&K on 18 September 2016 India did not participate in the su

An Interview with Liu Qing-quan a Chinese Medical physician and scholar who lead a nationwide team of Chinese medical experts in designing a treatment protocol for Wuhan Coronavirus. 
(Chinese version originally published in “Health Report” (???) by journalist Wang Ning (??) http:mini.eastday.coma200126020132257.html)

On January 21 Beijing Chinese Medical Hospital Chief Liu Qing-quan and China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Guang-an-men Hospital Emergency Department Chief Qi Wen-sheng arrived in Wu-han as part of the first delegation of Chinese Medical Specialists appointed by the National Administrative Bureau of Chinese Medicine and the National Health Bureau to take part in the frontline battle against Coronavirus. 

These two specialists have now returned to Beijing. In an exclusive interview this morning Health Daily journalist Wang Ning sat down and spoke with Liu Qing-quan about his experience in Wu-han. 

We should note that in 2003 during the SARS epidemic Liu Qing-quan was among the first to begin treating patients in epidemic-afflicted areas. He led a team of doctors saving patients and learning as he went. He also was part of a team of specialists that drafted an integrative medicine guideline for treatment. His work was instrumental in limiting and controlling the spread of SARS. 

The following content has been adapted from a recording of our interview with Hospital Chief Liu Qing-quan. 

How was the Chinese Medical treatment protocol formulated?

The four methods of diagnosis (observation auscultation and olfaction interrogation and pulse feeling) are central to Chinese medical diagnosis and treatment and to some degree they are even more important in these sudden outbreaks of new disease — as in previous epidemics are method is to go directly to the area afflicted and collect data regarding patients’ actual clinical symptomology and disease progression. With this data we then proceed to determine the cause and mechanism of the disease. Only once we have carried out a thorough analysis of the disease mechanism do we establish a syndrome differentiation and treatment protocol.  

We arrived in Wuhan on January 21 and in coordination with the National Health Bureau we were escorted directly to Jin-yin Lake Hospital (a hospital that exclusively treats infectious disease) where there was a relatively large number of hospitalized patients (with coronavirus). Once at the hospital we began a meticulous examination of patients’ symptomology disease progression tongue coating and pulse. On the first afternoon we probably examined over 60 patients including severe ICU cases and relatively stable patients in the general ward. 

Having conducted a thorough examination and collected a substantial amount of data we then called a meeting with a team comprised of 6 experts from the Wuhan City Chinese Medical Hospital the Wuhan City Integrative Medicine Hospital and the Jin-yin Lake Hospital of Chinese Medicine. We conducted an extended inquiry into the cause and location of disease as well as its mechanism and progression and combined our analysis with the recommendations of other experts from a number of top Wuhan Chinese Medicine hospitals. By 8:00pm we had formulated a tentative guideline which we then submitted to the National Administrative Bureau of Chinese Medicine. A national panel of experts convened in Beijing then carried out a second round of discussion and analysis and then drafted a preliminary protocol. This is the process that led to the publishing of the “Coronavirus Infection-Induced Pneumonia Treatment Protocol Version 3” Chinese Medicine treatment guideline.   

Simultaneously we also separated patients at the Jin-yin Lake Hospital into two groups based on severity of illness and distributed two separate formulas to be prescribed for immediate use. We also formulated a vital energyhealthy qi promoting tea to be used by medical staff.  

On January 22 we went to various other Chinese Medicine hospitals (Jin-yin Hospital was top priority because it was an infectious-disease hospital on day 2 they went to “general hospitals”) and designed treatment protocols for each medical tea

8 Questions & Answers 
By Dr. Wang Huan

1) Is the new coronavirus pneumonia curable?
 
On January 24 2020 two top international medical journals The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine published Chinese doctors and scientists experiences in the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus pneumonia. From the case summary the ability of this new virus to cause disease is lower than that of SARS in 2003.
 
New coronavirus pneumonia cases were first found in late December 2019 in Wuhan. More than 30 critically ill patients have been cured. Most patients with less severe symptoms were not hospitalized and were isolated at home where they improved and recovered.
 

Therefore as long as most patients do not have a secondary infection or other medical issues recovery can occur within 2-4 weeks.

 2) How to protect yourself?

In an interview by Zhong Nanshan the most authoritative respiratory expert from the National Academy of Engineering:

Pay attention to protect yourself but dont panic. 
Minimize visits to relatives and friends avoid crowded places as much as possible wear masks when going out pay attention to indoor ventilation and wash hands frequently.
 Avoid staying up late.

Wear a mask or cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or clothing when coughing or sneezing to reduce the spread of the virus. 

3) How can I tell if I have the new coronavirus pneumonia? 

Are there any specific symptoms to look for?

You cannot judge if you have this new coronavirus by yourself. Fever (some patients have no fever at the beginning of the illness) is a characteristic symptom of the new coronavirus pneumonia. This can be accompanied by a mild dry cough fatigue poor breathing or diarrhea. Once these symptoms appear further diagnosis is needed at the hospital.

4) Should I go to the hospital as soon as I get a fever? 

What is considered a mild illness?

Not all fever patients need to go to the hospital immediately.

Fever below 38°C with no difficulty breathing can be regarded as mild.
For patients with mild symptoms home isolation with oral over the counter medications can usually control the condition. It is not recommended that patients with mild symptoms go to the hospital repeatedly. This is due to potentially increasing cross-infection and exposing yourself to patients experiencing more severe symptoms.
In addition quarantined hospital patients are not allowed visitors.
Patients with symptoms can call a doctor from home to determine their condition and receive health guidance before deciding whether to go to a designated hospital to avoid cross-infection.*
If symptoms such as fever cough and difficulty breathing worsen take protective measures to see a designated hospital in time.

5) Why is it recommended to treat patients with mild symptoms at home?

Because there is no specific medicine for this new coronavirus infectious pneumonia and symptomatic supportive care is the main treatment. 

Oral medications (fever reducers cough medicines etc.) have the same treatment effect as injections in the hospital and good rest and nutrition can be done at home.

 6) If I need home isolation how do I choose an isolation location?

 

If you have access to multiple places it’s preferable to isolate yourself at one location.

Patients should be isolated to a single room with the door kept closed. The bathroom should not be shared with others to avoid contact with the patient’s bodily fluids.

Stay warm. If in isolation there is no need to keep windows open for long periods of time. 

  7) What are recommended diet and activities for patients in isolation at home?

 

Ensure adequate rest don’t stay up late and do not panic.

Drink plenty of water or chicken soupbroth. This is good for improving immunity.  

Eat more fruits and vegetables to achieve a balanced diet.

8) Some current myths circulating about the new coronavirus pneumonia.

Garlic water can treat the new coronavirus pneumonia. FALSE.

Drinking garlic water is neither a physical barrier like a mask nor a nutritional preventative.
 
Eating strawberries can prevent new coronavirus pneumonia. FALSE.

Strawberries can be part of a balanced diet but it is not possible for it or any other specific food to inhibit or prevent the new coronavirus.

???? (F?ng yóu j?ng néng - Wind Oil Essential Balm) can prevent the new coronavirus pneumonia.  FALSE. 

The main ingredients of Wind Oil Essential Balm are menthol methyl salicylate (holly oil) camphor eugenol and eucalyptus oil. None of its main ingredients has been proven to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. In addition methyl salicylate is toxic and if taken orally can cause poisoning. For children taking more than 4 ml can be fatal.
 

A vaccine against the new coronavirus pneumonia is out! FALSE.

 

There is no authoritative report about the successful development of a new coronavirus pneumonia vaccine. Regarding

Chart of the Week

- U.S. oil production is expected to average 13.3 million barrels per day (mbd) in 2020 an increase of 9 percent from last year according to the EIA. The agency sees output averaging 13.7 mbd in 2021. 
- The agency expects the rig count to continue to decline through most of 2020. But improved rig efficiency means that output could continue to climb albeit at a slower rate.
- The EIA sees the Permian averaging 5.2 mbd this year up 0.8 mbd from 2019. 

Market Movers

• Key Energy Services (NYSE: KEG) reached a debt restructuring agreement with creditors helping it avoid bankruptcy. Key is a well-services company based in Houston and it was delisted from the NYSE last year. 
• Eni (NYSE: E) announced a gas and condensate discovery in the Mahani onshore block in the UAE. 
• Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) was awarded seven contracts for drilling and completion services at the next phase of the Ichthys LNG project in Australia.

Tuesday January 28 2020

The coronavirus continues to send panic through global markets. Oil prices turned positive on Tuesday with WTI trading close to $54 and Brent just above $59. With tens of millions of people essentially locked down in China oil demand is expected to take a hit. 

OPEC mulls deeper cuts. The sharp drop in oil prices over the past week and fears about a renewed oil supply surplus has OPEC turning on the rumor mill again. An OPEC source says that the group will consider extending the cuts until June while other source said the group might also consider a deeper cut from current levels. The current deal expires in March.

Too much panic? Oil has declined by around $7 per barrel in a little over a week and some analysts think the selloff has gone too far. “Several questions remain unanswered about the potential fallout from the coronavirus but if the experience from the 2003 SARS outbreak is any indication demand worries are likely overdone” Barclays said in a note. Others agreed. “We believe coronavirus is a Chinese jet fuel demand story for now and not yet a global demand story” RBC Capital Markets wrote.

Libyan oil production falls to 280000 bpd. Libya’s oil production has plunged to 280000 bpd as the LNA continues to blockade the country’s oil export terminals. Libya has very little storage capacity so once filled output could soon fall further. The head of the National Oil Corp. said that the country’s oil production is rapidly falling to zero. 

Exxon’s stock hits 10-year low. ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) closed at a 10-year low on Monday. Bloomberg notes that the oil major is running a counter-cyclical strategy – spending heavily at a time when prices are low and supply is readily available – in order to profit from the next cycle. Most if its big projects – Guyana Mozambique Gulf Coast petrochemicals – will not “meaningfully begin contributing” to cash flow until 2023-2025 Scotiabank said. Goldman Sachs said that its “concern” is the “lack of free cash flow in the business model if oil prices do not recover.” 

Russia to complete Nord Stream 2. Gazprom will move forward without foreign companies in order to complete the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The project is nearly complete but has been delayed because of U.S. sanctions. “The Nord Stream 2 project which is already 94 per cent complete will be finished by the Russian side” Gazprom deputy head Elena Burmistrova said. 

BlackRock planning storage and renewables fund. The world’s largest asset manager is creating a multibillion-dollar renewable energy fund which follows on the heels of its decision to no longer finance coal projects. 

New Mexico to hit 1 mbd. The state of New Mexico likely surpassed 1 mbd of oil production in November according to Rystad Energy. The southeast corner of the state has become one of the hottest parts of the Permian. “Over half of the state’s oil production comes from wells set in 2019 making the sub-basin one of the areas with the youngest base production. This is putting pressure on base decline as younger wells decline faster” Rystad said. 

LNG prices continue to fall. JKM

Anche quest’anno seppure in un contesto personale di grave scompenso ipocondriaco causato dal coronavirus (lieve tosse e viaggio programmato in Asia) è arrivato il momento di spendere le solite due righe per celebrare l’inizio del Festival di Sanremo con il gruppo Poltronissima Ariston e redigere un’accurata analisi dei pezzi in gara soltanto sulla base dei testi delle canzoni.

Questa volta per agevolare le giocate dei tanti amici scommettitori a fianco del titolo del brano inserirò un valore percentuale a rappresentare la possibilità che la suddetta canzone si piazzi fra i primi tre classificati al termine del Festivàl.
Le vincite derivanti da questa operazione saranno in parte devolute alla mia Partita Iva a regime forfettario.

?Bugo e Morgan – “Sincero” (32%)

Pericolosamente in bilico fra l’autocritica e la disgrazia la coppia di quasi 50enni lancia la volata alla Legge Bacchelli di grande anticipo e si propone con il più classico dei pezzi “bilancio della mia vita artistica”. Non trattandosi del duo Little Tony e Bobby Solo scalderà soltanto i cuori di quei pochi nostalgici del rock anni ’90 col contratto a tempo indeterminato.

“Volevo fare il cantante
Delle canzoni inglesi
Così nessuno capiva che dicevo
Essere alcolizzato spaccare i camerini
E invece batto il cinque come uno scemo”

?Anastasio – “Rosso di rabbia” (89%)

Andrà bene per Anastasio. E’ evidente che dietro la tessera del partito nazista si nasconde un ragazzo confuso e arrabbiato figlio del suo tempo con grande sensibilità per le parole. Dopodiché alla ventesima canzone che parla della sua rabbia l’uomo della strada può anche chiedersi “Ma in fondo a me della rabbia del sig. Anastasio cosa me ne fotte?”

“Ma ciò che mi rattrista è il terrorista
Esposto al pubblico ludibrio
La sua bomba era una farsa dal principio
Amico non ti invidio”

?Irene Grandi – “Finalmente io” (75%)

Dopo averci provato con Noemi Vasco Rossi ritorna a scrivere un testo sanremese che parla di donne incasinate ma consapevoli scappate di casa spettinate e con l’alito di sigaretta ma pur sempre veraci indistruttibili e che prendono a calci nelle palle il commercialista. Dolcemente complicate sbronze e malinconiche mentre si passano il rasoio sotto la doccia della palestra. Dovrei scriverli io questi testi non Vasco Rossi.

“Innamorata della libertà
Ho perso ogni pazienza e ogni fragilità
Da sempre arrabbiata da sempre sbagliata
E ancora così”

?Achille Lauro – “Me ne frego” (88%)

Nonostante il successo esplosivo della scorsa edizione ogni volta che sento nominare Achille Lauro penso al transatlantico dirottato dal fronte di liberazione palestinese. Questo corto circuito rappresenta la distanza artistica fra il sottoscritto e questo nuovo prodotto culturale italiano nostalgico citazionista e figlio legittimo di Toto Cutugno. Io continuo con Alberto Camerini.

“Sì me ne frego
Prenditi gioco di me che ci credo
St’amore è panna montata al veleno
Ne voglio ancora”

?Diodato – “Fai rumore” (57%)

Sogno un mondo in cui Diodato e la Lamborghini salgono sul palco scambiandosi la canzone e il vestito mandando così in corto circuito il mondo dell’indie tanto da far aprire un varco nella terra da cui escono Tommaso Paradiso de I The Giornalisti Vincenzo Mollica Mario Luzzatto Fegiz Paola Maugeri Maccarini e Red Ronnie che mangia snack di orecchie di maiale fritte.
“Ma fai rumore sì
Che non lo posso sopportare
Questo silenzio innaturale”

?Alberto Urso – “Il sole ad est” (75%)

Cresciuto nel sottobosco della televisione italiana Alberto Urso si è trasformato da tenorino chiattunciello a modello instagram con sopracciglia affilate vincendo un’edizione di Maria De Filippi. Il testo vacuo tipico del desiderio amoroso del 1908 unito al desiderio tutto italiano per un’esibizione de Il Volo fanno di Alberto Ursus uno dei più vigorosi candidati all’exploit.

“Ho nel cuore il sole ad est
E nel mondo ovunque vada
Mi ricorderà la strada
Che porta fino a te”

?Elodie – “Andromeda” (68%)

Bella & brava la nostra Elodie porta sul palco una rivisitazione contemporanea del mito di Andromeda e Perseo raccontando di una donna forte dignitosa e pronta alle sfide della vita. Di solito queste cose le fa quel capoccione di Max Gazzè quindi mi sembra evidente che la musica si stia evolvendo verso il meglio.

“Ci penso qua sul letto mentre ascolto da ore
La solita canzone di Nina Simone
Una volta 100 volte chiedimi perché
Esser grandi ma immaturi è più facile ma perché”

?Francesco Gabbani – “Viceversa” (78%)

A me forse piace. Potrebbe rivelarsi una canzone d’amore dignitosissima e stupire Gabbani stesso.
“Ma l’amore di normale non ha neanche le parole
Parlano di pace e fanno la rivoluzione
Dittatori in testa e partigiani dentro al cuore”

?Marco Masini – “Il confront

Even Xi Jinping China’s general secretary said it’s a grave situation and China is not the type of country to say shit like that and not mean it to its full extent.

Summary of press conference by Professor Gabriel Leung Hong Kong Univ. Dean Of Medicine

I made the following notes during the press conference by Professor Gabriel Leung.(https:www.youtube.comwatch?v=aYyH4N8VXvA) He is the Dean of Medicine at Hong Kong University and led HKs efforts against H1N1 in 2009. 

I was only able to summarize the English portions. Also I apologize if I have misnamed or mistaken any Chinese cities I did my best to transcribe them correctly.

**GL:** The report I am about to share with you(https:www.med.hku.hkfnews35497418Wuhan-coronavirus-outbreak_AN-UPDATE_20200127.pdf) (PDF) is also being immediately sent to the authorities in Beijing and to the WHO.

**GL:** The epidemic is growing at an exponential accelerating rate. The real question is given the lag between infection incubation symptom onset hospital admission treatment and then recovering or perishing given that lag we used our mathematical model to try and infer how many cases there **actually arewere (as of two days ago)** in Wuhan and other places in mainland China.

**GL:** the basic reproductive number we measure as **2.13** - this is the best estimate we have at the moment. A doubling time of six days *in the absence* of any public health interventions is expected.

**GL:** (explaining a graph presentation) The number of clinically apparent cases we model to be ***25 to 26 thousand as of Chinese New Year Day.*** The number of **total infections when including presymptomatic cases approaches 44 thousand.**

**GL:** Wuhan is extensively connected to the North South East and West of China. The number of cases exported from Wuhan to the rest of mainland China in our model as of Jan25 range from 18 in Qingdao to a high of 318 in Chongqing. The numbers will be higher by now. But thats not the most important point. There have been megalopolis quarantines since Jan23. **We ran the model with and without the quarantines accounted for and the forecasts are very similar.** The quarantines may not be able to substantially change the course of the epidemic curves in other major Chinese city clusters.

**GL:** We modeled epidemic curves out to August 2020 for all the major city clusters in China: **Chongqing Shanghai-Guangzhou Shenzhen and Beijing. Chongqing is predicted to have the largest epidemic** due to large population and most intense traffic volume coupled to Wuhan. The timing of the peak is sometime in **April to May 2020** one to two weeks in Chonqing before the other major city clusters (except Wuhan which will peak even earlier). 

**GL:** a special note on HK and Macao. They are also linked to Gzhou and Shenzhen by rail which may (be more important than?) the links direct from HKMacao to Wuhan. (His speech is not clear here). 

**GL:** We are expecting to see **Self sustaining epidemic clusters** - not just repeated exports from Wuhan but actually a local self sustaining epidemic - within **all five?four? of the major city clusters of China.** 

**GL:** The question is now whether *those* predicted self sustaining epidemics will in turn seed such local epidemics overseas. The four BjShGzShz account for 53% of all international travel in the country and 70% of all international air travel out of Asia originating from mainland China. **These four are highly likely to seed local epidemics in connected ports overseas.**

**GL:** The conclusion that we draw from this analysis - why its important to submit it publicly immediately after sending to WHO - **The epidemic in Wuhan as a precautionary principle we must be prepared for it to become a global epidemic. This is not a certainty but there is a not weak not insubstantial not trivial chance that this will happen.**

**GL:** There is already self sustaining chains of transmission modeled in the major Chinese cities. (Because the four mega city clusters have such high population?) if these cities were in turn to become significant exporters of virus (due to the acceleration of their epidemic curves?) they would have a

Freeport-McMoran Inc (N:FCX) the worlds largest publicly traded copper producer would consider acquisitions mergers or other deals once three ongoing expansion projects finish by 2022 Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said in an interview on Tuesday.

Demand for copper is projected to surge this decade because of the rising popularity of electric vehicles which use twice as much copper as internal combustion engines. That in turn is expected to fuel an M&A wave across the sector.

Despite that Phoenix Arizona-based Freeports shares are worth half what they were in 2010 dragged down by uncertainty over the companys stake in a major Indonesian mine and debt from an ill-fated oil and gas venture.

But those issues are largely behind the company which is about to open a copper mine in the United States is expanding Indonesias Grasberg mine and has launched an analytics program to boost production in Peru.

Those projects should double the companys cash flow and boost the companys stock price giving the company ammunition to consider deals Adkerson told Reuters.

Im looking forward to having a new experience in my career toward accessing alternatives and deciding which way we go said Adkerson an accountant by training who became CEO in 2003.

Those alternatives could include buying part or all of another company building new mines or other deals he said.

We dont have a clear directive now on what that direction could be but we will be attractively situated and will have an opportunity to add value through investments said Adkerson.

According to recent news reports Barrick Gold Corp (TO:ABX) CEO Mark Bristow has spoken favorably of Freeports assets and a potential combination.

Adkerson declined to comment. A Barrick spokeswoman declined to comment.

Adkerson 73 said he has no plans to retire and is in good health.

This is not a time that Im thinking about walking away he said.

Adkerson called the outbreak of a deadly coronavirus in China a real black swan event. The term is a reference to the book Black Swan which looks at the potentially catastrophic effects of unpredictable events.

Copper prices have dropped more than 10% this month on concerns the virus could affect the global economy. Copper prices are closely linked to global economic health because the metal is used for construction and manufacturing.

Freeports stock dropped more than 9% last Thursday due in part to virus concerns even as the company posted better-than-expected quarterly results.

Builders have been making concrete the same way for hundreds of years: by mixing sand with various binding materials.

However a team of researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder has a different approach. They’re making a new kind of concrete one that is alive and can even replicate itself.

It’s made using a common type of microbe: cyanobacteria. This type of organism gets its energy through photosynthesis.

The field of synthetic biology is booming with researchers exploring new ways to build and new materials to work with. Recently a different team has proposed the use of mycelium as another type of building material.

A major advantage of this new type of concrete is that it can heal itself repairing any cracks that may appear.

The new concrete type was recently detailed in the journal Matter. “We already use biological materials in our buildings like wood but those materials are no longer alive” Wil Srubar an assistant professor in the Department of Civil Environmental and Architectural Engineering (CEAE) said in a news statement. “We’re asking: Why can’t we keep them alive and have that biology do something beneficial too?”

So how did the group build this new type of living concrete? First the researchers tried putting the cyanobacteria in a mixture containing warm water sand and other nutrients. The microbes began producing calcium carbonate and gradually cemented the sand particles together.

But the process was extremely slow — too slow in fact for the project’s funder Darpa the Department of Defense’s research offshoot.

The team switched its focus to gelatin a food ingredient that once dissolved in water and cooled created special bonds between its molecules. The team decided to try adding gelatin to the bacteria mixture.

Success! The gelatin not only provided more structure but also worked with the bacteria and the result was faster-growing living concrete. It took about a day for the bacteria to form concrete blocks and although it was weaker than conventional concrete it was sturdy enough for a person to stand on.

Blocks ranged in size from two-inch cubes to shoebox-sized to larger truss pieces. When stored in relatively dry air and at room temperature it takes a few days for the blocks to reach their maximum strength. The bacteria can survive for several weeks and even be rejuvenated – resulting in further growth­. Under the right conditions of course.

“We know that bacteria grow at an exponential rate” Srubar said. “That’s different than how we say 3D-print a block or cast a brick. If we can grow our materials biologically then we can manufacture at an exponential scale.”

DARPA is extremely interested in this research and in self-growing material in general. That’s because it can be used to build structures in remote and inhospitable areas such as the desert or even outer space.

If the living concrete can prove to be scalable that would reduce the number of materials that we will need to launch which is a huge deal when even pound counts.

It’s much easier to bring biology with us than to carry bulky building materials to space. Perhaps the first humans on Mars will live in habitats fashioned out of cyanobacteria concrete bricks or even mushrooms.

“Nature has figured out how to do a lot of things in a clever and efficient way” Srubar said. “In austere environments these materials would perform especially well because they use light from the sun to grow and proliferate with very little exogenous material needed for their growth” added Srubar. “It’s going to happen one way or another and we’re not going to be trucking bags of cement all the way to Mars. I really do think that we’ll be bringing biology with us once we go.”

B.C. confirms provinces first presumptive positive case of new coronavirus

Published Tuesday January 28 2020 8:21AM PST
Last Updated Tuesday January 28 2020 11:38AM PST

VANCOUVER -- The first presumptive positive case of novel coronavirus has been detected in British Columbia health officials confirmed Tuesday.
The B.C. Centre for Disease Control said one patient appears to be infected with the newly discovered coronavirus and is currently in isolation at home.
The individual is a 40-year-old male who travels to China regularly and was in Wuhan city on his most recent trip officials said. He lives in the Vancouver Coastal Health region.
This is a gentleman who is well aware of what is going on in China and when he went home he voluntarily self-isolated said Dr. Bonnie Henry at a news conference Tuesday.

The man contacted a health-care provider on Jan. 26 to let them known he had travelled to Wuhan and was experiencing symptoms. 

That health-care provider gave a diagnostic test which came back positive on Monday night. 

The man was monitoring his own symptoms carefully and his family is also being monitored by Vancouver Coastal Health. Henry said the man arrived back in Vancouver last week and his symptoms began showing more than 24 hours after arriving home.
This person is currently doing well and does not need hospitalization Henry said. This person was not symptomatic on his flight. 

Henry said there is no evidence that the virus spreads when a person is asymptomatic.

Thats reassuring to us and thats certainly in line with other coronavirus infections that weve seen in the past like SARS and MERS Henry said. 

Right now the mans case is considered presumptive positive because confirmation is done by a second test at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. 

The sample is on its way to Winnipeg Henry said. But given the history of travel the contact that this person had in Wuhan city and the symptoms they were showing we are confident that this truly is a case of this novel coronavirus.

Henry said NMLs test result is expected in about 48 hours but that she is confident in the result found by the B.C. labs test. 

Case no surprise officials say

Henry added that with the high amount of travel between Metro Vancouver and China the presumptive positive case didnt come as a surprise. 

This first case is not unexpected to us she said. 

This does not change what we are doing in British Columbia … I would have been surprised if we did not have one or two cases.

Henry cautioned against listening to rumours of B.C. cases saying that the provincial ministry will continue to update the public if more cases are confirmed. 

There has been a small number of people around the province that have been tested for this novel coronavirus and we have a very low threshold for that testing Henry said. There have been a number of tests that have been done this is the first one that has been positive. 

Prevention and screening measures

In a news release from the ministry of health the province said the general public doesnt necessarily need to take extra measures to protect themselves from the virus.

It is not necessary for the general public to take special precautions beyond the usual measures recommended to prevent other common respiratory viruses during the winter period the news release said.

Regular handwashing coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve disposing of tissues appropriately and avoiding contact with sick people are important ways to prevent the spread of respiratory illness generally. 

Previously the BC Centre for Disease Control has developed a diagnostic test for the novel coronavirus and health-care workers have been asked to record the travel history for anyone reporting respiratory symptoms.

Travellers passing through Vancouver International Airport are also being screened when they arrive at the airport particularly if theyve visited Wuhan China where the virus is believed to have originated.

Other cases in Canada

In Ontario two cases have been recorded. One case has been confirmed while the second is considered presumptive positive.

Symptoms of the virus include a runny nose headache cough sore throat fever and a general feeling of being unwell.

Anyone who is concerned they may have been exposed to or are experiencing symptoms of the coronavirus should contact their primary-care provider local public health office or call 811 the province said. 

The outbreak of the virus began on Dec. 31 with what was initially believed to be a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan the capital city of Chinas Hubei province.

Officials have since confirmed the patients were actually infected with a virus never previously identified in humans which has been dubbed the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.

January 28 2020

By Tracy Rucinski

CHICAGO (Reuters) – United Airlines Holdings Inc <UAL.O> said on Tuesday it was suspending some flights between the United States and Beijing Hong Kong and Shanghai between Feb. 1 and Feb. 8 due to a “significant decline in demand” as the new coronavirus spreads.

“We will continue to monitor the situation as it develops and will adjust our schedule as needed” United said in a statement.

The coronavirus that originated in Wuhan China has killed 106 people in the Asian country and spread across the world rattling financial markets.

United’s suspension affects a total of 24 flights.

The other two U.S. airlines that fly to China Delta Air Lines Inc <DAL.N> and American Airlines Group Inc <AAL.O> said they had not reduced their flights at this time but were closely monitoring the situation.

?

The first presumptive case of coronavirus has been confirmed in BC.
“We are here to let you know that late yesterday we had our first case confirmed of a person here in BC” said Dr. Bonnie Henry Provincial Health Officer in a joint statement with Adrian Dix Minister of Health this morning.
The man is in his 40s who regularly travels to China for work and was in Wuhan last week on a work trip.
He is a resident of the Vancouver Coastal Health region.
“On Sunday January 26 he followed public health messaging contacted a primary health-care provider to notify them that he had travelled to Wuhan city was experiencing symptoms and would be coming for assessment and care” said Henry.
“Following established protocols the primary-care provider notified the Vancouver Coastal Health medical health officer and administered the diagnostic test.”
Last night the test came back positive. Public health officials are in regular contact with the man and he is in isolation at his home.
A second test of the lab results will be done at the National Microbiology Laboratory Winnipeg. Cases are considered presumptive until confirmed at the Winnipeg lab. The secondary testing will be completed in several days.
Both Henry and Dix say the “risk of spreading this virus within British Columbia remains low at this time.”
“All necessary precautions are being taken to prevent the spread of infection. We have multiple systems in place to prepare for detect and respond in order to prevent the spread of serious infectious diseases in the province” read the statement.
The BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) has developed a diagnostic test for the new coronavirus and is co-ordinating staff and supplies to ensure all potential cases can be detected “quickly and accurately.”

Risk remains “low to British Columbians”: BCCDC

On its website the BCCDC is reminding the risk to British Columbians “is considered low” but is being monitored closely.
As of January 27 2020 there have been 2888 globally confirmed cases  (2846 of these within regions of China). There have also been 81 deaths which have all occurred within regions of China.
Cases of the virus were first reported in Wuhan City China in December 2019. BCCDC says illnesses associated with the new coronavirus are “similar to several respiratory illnesses and include fever dry cough sore throat and headache.”

Coronavirus in Canada

As of Monday Canada had one confirmed case of coronavirus and one presumptive case both of which are in Toronto. The Government of Ontario confirmed that the wife of the province’s first case of the Wuhan novel coronavirus has tested positive for the virus.
The couple both in their mid-50s had recently travelled to Wuhan.
Three people are being investigated in the province for potential cases of the coronavirus according to Quebec’s health and social services ministry.

Canadian outbreak updates can be found on the Government of Canada’s website.
The Government of Canada has also increased its travel risk advisory to parts of China.
According to Global Affairs Canadians should now avoid all travel to Hubei Province including the cities of Wuhan Huanggang and Ezhou “due to the imposition of heavy travel restrictions in order to limit the spread of a novel coronavirus.”
The federal government said that on January 22 Chinese authorities asked the public to avoid all non-essential travel to and from the city of Wuhan Hubei Province “in the hopes of containing a novel coronavirus.”
François-Philippe Champagne Minister of Foreign Affairs said the government is in contact with and providing assistance to Canadians currently on the ground.
“We continue to advise Canadians to avoid non-essential travel to the province of Hubei China including the cities of Wuhan Huanggang and Ezhou due to the heavy travel restrictions that have been imposed” he said.

Nature Magazine 27 JANUARY 2020
Scientists are increasingly concerned about a new virus that has infected thousands of people and can be deadly. The virus is a coronavirus and belongs to the same family as the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS. It causes a respiratory illness can spread from person to person and emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December.

Here’s the latest news on the outbreak.

29 January 04:00 GMT — Australian researchers grow virus in cell culture

Researchers in Melbourne Australia are the first outside China to announce that they’ve grown the new coronavirus in cell culture. The group at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity says it isolated the virus from the first person diagnosed with the infection in Australia on 25 January.

The team will now share the virus with research labs around the world recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to help the development of more accurate diagnostic tests and vaccines says Mike Catton a deputy director of the institute. “There are some things that are much easier to do when you have the virus” says Catton.

Although scientists in China say they’ve been able to grow the virus in the lab they have not yet shared samples with international researchers — they have shared only the virus’s genetic sequence says Julian Druce head of the Virus Identification Laboratory at the Doherty Institute. He says he and his team had heard that labs outside China had struggled to grow the virus but they found it quite easy. He thinks the success was due to the lab’s combined expertise in diagnosing infections as well as isolating and growing viruses in culture. “We’ve got two parts of the puzzle together in one laboratory” he says.

Catton says having samples of the virus will enable scientists to create tests that can detect specific immune cells — antibodies — that indicate whether a person has been infected with the new virus. Such tests are especially useful for people with mild or no symptoms. Making a test for antibodies is difficult without samples of the virus he says.

A study of a family in Shenzhen China identified a child who was infected with the virus but showed no symptoms. The WHO has also reported that three people with the infection outside China have been asymptomatic.

Ian Mackay a virologist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane Australia says the Melbourne group’s announcement is fantastic news. He says lab-grown samples are essential for research into the behaviour of the virus in culture or in animal hosts. Although virus samples can also be used to validate molecular diagnostic tests most labs have moved away from using whole viruses in favour of synthetically producing parts of the virus from partial genomes says Mackay.

28 January 16:00 GMT — First human-to-human transmission outside China

The new coronavirus has spread between humans outside China for the first time.

A German man acquired the infection from a colleague who had returned from Wuhan according to news reports and a statement from Bavaria’s health ministry. In a 27 January update the World Health Organization confirmed that a person in Vietnam had acquired the virus from an infected family member. And media reports indicated today that a tour-bus driver in Japan who had transported tourists from Wuhan had also tested positive for the coronavirus.

China coronavirus: Six questions scientists are asking
Bavaria’s health ministry said it considered the risk of the virus spreading further to be low. However more cases of human-to-human spread outside China are likely said Michael Head an epidemiologist at the University of Southampton UK in a statement distributed by the UK Science Media Centre. “But the indications are at this stage that onwards transmission will be limited.”

David Heymann an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine agrees that more cases of human-to-human transmission beyond China are likely. Health authorities can limit transmission by isolating infected people and closely following individuals they have had contact with.

But these measures will be effective only if the virus is not able to spread widely through the air. “You can generally keep an outbreak at very low levels unless it’s aerosolized” says Heymann. If the virus can spread through the air contact-tracing and isolation are unlikely to stem transmission.

Evidence so far suggests that the coronavirus spreads only through close contact and through saliva droplets but Heymann

Jul 23 2015 - THE PIRBRIGHT INSTITUTE 
 http:patents.justia.compatent10130701  Believe it or not the coronavirus strain that’s currently spreading throughout China and abroad is a patented virus that’s owned by an entity called The Pirbright Institute which is partially funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. https:www.naturalnews.com2020-01-27-bill-gates-funded-pirbright-institute-owns-coronavirus-patent.html  BREAKING: CEPI (funded by Gates) Grants INOVIO $9M To Develop Vaccine Against Coronavirus nCoV-2019 https:www.youtube.comwatch?v=oD8sI1ydH9Q Yall get it yet??? SIMULATION FOR CORONAVIRUS RAN 3 MONTHS AGO BY JOHN HOPKINS SCIENTIST https:www.youtube.comwatch?v=HHfFnspl7Hw The patent page for coronavirus explains that it “may be used as a vaccine for treating andor preventing a disease such as infectious bronchitis in a subject” suggesting that this is just another weaponized viral strain designed to sell more useless deadly vaccines while at the same time killing off a few thousand or perhaps a few million people. Its NOT a Conspiracy Theory! Heres the PROOF! The Coronavirus was patented here in the US in 2015 https:nationaladdictionnews.com20200128its-not-a-conspiracy-theory-heres-the-proof-the-corona-virus-was-patented-here-in-the-us-in-2015 Its NOT a Conspiracy Theory! Heres the PROOF! The Coronavirus was patented here in the US in 2015

I as well as all of you have been reading a great deal about the Coronavirus as it has been rapidly spreading in China and now in other countries (including the US). There have been conspiracy theorists who claim it is a weaponized virus while others bash the idea by coming against that.

So to remain impartial I have posted the patent on the Coronavirus for you to make the decision for yourself. Hint: It’s about including it in vaccines as well as using it as a vaccine to prevent(???) an array of diseases. Decide for yourselves. In the end we all have to formulate what we think is the truth and placing this information here is by no means my way of persuading you one way or another.

January 22 2020 by Mike Adams editor Natural News

The next wave of attack against humanity has just been unleashed. The so-called “novel coronavirus” (2019-nCoV) is now spreading across Mainland China and with the Chinese New Year travel surge under way China’s residents are “exporting” the virus everywhere. Confirmed cases have cropped up in Taiwan and the CDC has confirmed that at least one patient in the United States has been infected and hospitalized (after being misdiagnosed for a week during which he most likely spread the infections to others).

NOTE: Natural News is currently functioning in “emergency” mode after suffering a severe cyber attack that has temporarily disconnected us from our own data servers. Site functionality is very limited until we restore full connectivity. Thank you for your prayers as we navigate this latest malicious attempt to silence our journalism.

As covered by Alt Market:

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday confirmed the first U.S. case of a new coronavirus that has killed six people in China.

The CDC and Washington state officials said the man in his 30s was in good condition at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett. The symptoms presented Sunday and the diagnosis was confirmed Monday.

Nancy Messonnier director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases called the news “concerning” particularly in light of reports that the virus has begun to spread from person to person.

“The confirmation of human-to-human spread in Asia certainly increases our concern” Messonnier said.

The CDC which began enhanced health screenings last week at airports in San Francisco New York and Los Angeles said Atlanta and Chicago would be added to the list. All traveling from Wuhan China – where the outbreak began – to the USA are rerouted to these airports.

Cases have been found spreading to Japan South Korea Thailand Taiwan the Philippines Australia and now the United States reports DC Clothesline.

Already in Mexico?
One case of coronavirus which has been confirmed in Mexico involves a 57-year-old Asian man whose stops included Tijuana Beijing and Wuhan where the outbreak is known to be spreading. According to Breitbart News “According to a statement from the Tamaulipas Health Secretariat a level three health protocol was triggered after a college professor was identified as a possible carrier of Coronavirus.””This is serious business” warned Dr. Peter Hotez Dean of the Molecular Virology and Microbiology Department at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston in a Breitbart interview. “We are now seeing person-to-person spreading of the virus.”

Hotez recommends that everyone get a flu vaccine by the way even though this year’s flu vaccine has nothing whatsoever to do with the coronavirus that’s spreading in China.

Upwards of 20000 people already infected in China according to estimates
“Chinese health authorities announced Wednesday that 440 confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) had been reported in 13 provincial-level regions in the country by the end of Tuesday” reports The Big Wobble. “According to Prof Neil Ferguson’s table (see below) of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London 440 confirmed cases is the equivalent of almost 20000 unconfirmed cases.”The Big Wobble goes on to explain “Published 5 days ago 45 confirmed cases was the equivalent of up to 2000 cases Today 440 confirmed cases is therefore the equivalent of almost 20000 unconfirmed cases according to Prof Neil Ferguson.”

The conclusion of Prof. Ferguson’s analysis:

It is likely that the Wuhan outbreak of a novel coronavirus has caused substantially more cases of moderate or severe respiratory illness than currently reported.

Dave Hodges has also posted more details about “patient zero” in the United States.

A bioengineered weaponized viral strain
What seems obvious from the rapid adaption of this viral strain — which has now achieved “human-to-human transmission” — is that it has been engineered as a self-replicating weapon system to achieve the globalists’ depopulation goals.The long incubation period that seems to be presently observed allows this viral strain to spread in “stealth” mode largely undetected until its payload fully activates. The longer the incubation period the more people are infected and become silent carriers (who may not even know they are infected).

Currently this coronavirus is believed to have a low fatality rate something less than 5%. However this may change as the viral strain adapts or is altered through transgenic effects emerging from exposure to other circulating viral strains. In other words viral strains can in certain cases recombine their proteins t

BABA. Makki Abubakar
Member Federal House Of Representatives Representing Mallammadori and Kaugama Federal Constituency Has  Attended The Parlarnary Session After Resuming.

PROTOCOLS

Good morning honourable colleagues. I welcome you all back to the chambers after the Christmas and New Year holidays and I thank you all for being here this morning. Though the House has not been in session these past few weeks I am aware that for many of us the work has never stopped and the obligations we hold have not been any less demanding. Still I hope that you have taken time to rest to recover and to prepare yourselves for the responsibilities that will continue to demand our time our abilities and our continued efforts.

Yesterday we stood to observe a moment’s silence in memory of our colleague Hon. Muhammadu Fagen-Gawo who passed away recently. My dear colleagues this 9th House of Representatives has in its very short lifetime suffered the loss of too many of our members. I am deeply troubled by this development. Yes it is God who gives life and it is God who takes life. We will not question the decisions of our maker. Nonetheless allow me to say once more as I have said before in this chamber that faithful execution of the responsibilities of our office requires of us that we pay close attention to our personal health. This is still very true. Beyond the obligations of our office we have other responsibilities as fathers and mothers brothers and sisters sons and daughters that require us to take matters of our personal health with the utmost care. Let us never lose sight of this fact. And may God guide protect and keep us all in good health and good fortune.

Upon the inauguration of this 9th House of Representatives in June 2019 we hit the ground running working with the executive and engaging the citizens of our country to discover and present solutions to the problems of our country. Some of our efforts have already yielded positive results in certain regards and I am hopeful that we will continue in this new year to meet and exceed the standards that we have set for ourselves.

For the first time since 1999 we have a budget passed by the legislature and signed into law before the start of the implementation year. I commend and thank all the members of this House for your efforts towards achieving early passage of the Appropriation Act 2020 and the Finance Act both of which have now been signed into law by His Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari GCFR. Honourable colleagues passing the budget into law is merely the beginning. We now have a duty to ensure faithful compliance with the letter and spirit of the law by the ministries departments and agencies (MDAs) of the Federal Government. We will carry out this responsibility and we will do so with integrity taking pains to ensure that we leave no room for neither friends nor foes to find fault with our words or deeds.

That Appropriation Act reflects the priorities of this government. These priorities are the same today as they have always been to develop public infrastructure to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population to facilitate investment in new and existing industries to provide educational opportunities for all our people and build an economy that allows every citizen to achieve their just ambitions. Our role as legislators is to ensure that the agencies responsible for implementing this budget maintain fidelity to these priorities. We will not be afraid to hold people’s feet to the fire where necessary. Where it is required of us that we act to review and update legislation we will do so too. We will not act alone we will not be arbitrary in our interventions. We will seek collaboration as a matter of course so that our interventions do not exacerbate existing problems or create new ones.

In this new year this House will further take all necessary action to pass into law the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) and to implement the much needed and long-delayed reforms of the sector. It is an unavoidable truth that the oil and gas industry is integral to the economic life of Nigeria. Achieving efficient operation in this sector is therefore a matter of national survival. We cannot allow these much-needed and too long-delayed reforms to continue to be hostage to the privileged interests of a few or the myopic considerations of those whose interests are served by the status quo. We will seek reform we will achieve reform and we will do so in collaboration with the executive with stakeholders in the industry and with those communities that most directly bear the highest costs of our exploration and sale of fossil fuels.

In 2019 the House of Representatives led interventions to address the challenges faced by the less abled

Facet Music has consulted the government and Alberta Health Services about holding concerts in light of the situation with the coronavirus outbreak in China. Their answer was ”the risk is extremely low”. Unfortunately this doesn’t account for the community’s fear of gatherings right now which will drastically affect the attendance of our upcoming events. 

It is therefore with great regret that Facet Music has decided to cancel the February 2 show of Song of the Phoenix - 2020 Calgary Chinese New Year Concert. 

However we will go ahead with the February 1 show. We will combine the audience from both nights onto that evening. If any ticket holders for the February 2 show do not wish to come on February 1 we will refund their tickets. We will contact ticket holders presently.

Facet Music is donating half the box office proceeds toward providing protective face masks and other medical supplies to those who need them in China.

We sincerely hope for your understanding under these difficult circumstances.

In June 2012 the first human with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection was found in Saudi Arabia. The one was a 60-year old man. He visited a hospital due to pneumonia it was later found out that renal failure developed (1). He eventually died due to his illnesses. From 1 June 2015 1154 patients were infected with the virus 431 patients died (WHO http:www.who.intcsrdonarchivediseasecoronavirus_infectionsen). MERS is suspected to spread from animals to humans like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It was from a similar coronavirus with respiratory infection syndromes and it is highly transmitted. Additionally since the virus is related to a high rate of fatality it has become a big issue for public health doctors and officials over the world.
The latency period of MERS-CoV is known to be between 2 to 14 days (median 5.4 days). From the development of the disease to the patients admission it takes 4 days and the period that people die from the disease takes 11.5 days (2). In the first stage flu like symptoms such as fever coughing chilling myalgia and arthralgia are observed. After this respiratory difficulty is added. This quickly progresses to pneumonia (3). A part (30%) of the patients complain of bowel symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea (1). Cases of MERS-CoV can be found in countries like America UK France Tunisia Italy Malaysia the Philippines Greece Egypt the Netherlands Algeria Austria Turkey etc. whose citizens have travelled to the Middle East.
On May 20 2014 a man at the age of 68 was the first to be diagnosed with MERS-Cov in Korea. He travelled to Bahrain Saudi Arabia and Qatar for 16 days. On May 4 2015 this patient entered in Korea and febrile sense and respiratory symptoms appeared on May 11. He visited Clinic A on the day and was admitted to Hospital B from May 15 to 17. Since the symptoms got worsened he visited Clinic C on May 18 and finally he was transferred to a university hospital in Seoul on May 18. On May 20 it was confirmed that he was suffering from MERS-CoV. After finding out about the disease his family members and medical staffs who had been exposed to the virus were isolated. By June 9 2015 2 medical staffs in the Clinic A and C one medical staff in the Hospital B one patient and her wife who was together with the index case in the same room and 35 of admitted patients in the same ward and their family members visiting same ward with the index case in the Hospital B were confirmed to have been infected with MERS-CoV. After then several tertiary cases were identified in the Hospital B or other hospitals that secondary patients were transferred from the Hospital B. A total of 108 people were infected and 9 (8.3%) of them died by June 10 2015.
One person among the 36 patients exposed in the Hospital B left for China through Hong Kong because the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could not confirm the exposure to the index case. China CDC is performing isolated treatments. Hong Kong and China CDC started to manage people who are suspected to be exposed.
At present the outbreak pattern in Korea has been progressing similarly to the hospital outbreak occurred in the Middle East. The secondary infection developed in people who had a close contact with the person who was initially infected. Medical staffs who were inv

So whats going on with the virus is the CDC is putting the DNA into sequences but everyday its changing they cant find the gene sequencing details it changes every day.
So when they update the DNA database for thle virus its getting more difficult for find the details
For example an infection today might be majorly different from tomorrow
Remember 7 days it takes for infections to show up in people. Plus it can be transferred to people without any symptoms in 1 to 2 days.
China is experiencing an outbreak of the novel coronavirus discovered in Wuhans wet market. Over 55 million people quarantined accurate numbers are unavailable due to shortages of test kits and travelers have spread cases to at least 19 countries.

Thousands of Applicants Set To Miss 2020 UTME in 11 States - JAMB warns
18:22  Education

The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has released a list of suspended Computer Based Test centres ahead of the 2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME).

Premium Times reports that an official of the examination body has said that thousands of candidates who are registered in 38 centres across the country may miss writing their UTME.

The official said the centres were suspended from conducting the UTME because the operators defaulted by disobeying the rules governing the registration of candidates as provided by the examination board.

Also reacting to the situation the JAMB registrar Ishaq Oloyede said the board has handed over 38 CBT operators to the police for further investigation.

Anxiety as revenue commission begins review of salaries of political office holders plans to recover over N100bn Oloyede said these centres operators illegally moved their registration facilities outside their previously allocated locations.

By BALTIMORE SUN EDITORIAL BOARD

BALTIMORE SUN

JAN 24 2020 | 5:23 PM

??

A woman in Roland Park used the N-word to describe middle school students during an argument raising concerns in the community. (Amy Davis  Baltimore Sun)

The racially restrictive covenants that maintained segregation for decades in North Baltimore may be gone but their message persists in some ways in the affluent mostly white communities there: It’s still true that not everyone is welcomed by everyone.

We saw it in the “racially charged” Halloween costumes worn by some private school students from Gilman Boys’ Latin and Roland Park Country School in 2017. And then again that same year in the Roland Park Civic League’s request later retracted that a handful of residents remove yard signs supporting immigrants and the Black Lives Matter movement because such “clutter can be a nuisance.” It’s inferred from the way some white folks cut in front of some black patrons at Johnny’s restaurant and implied in the warnings posted on neighborhood social media sites about African American men daring to knock on doors.

This month the message was overt. And it was directed toward children.

During an after school incident two weeks ago that was described to The Sun by parents and in social media posts some Roland Park Middle school boys were acting like middle school boys can at their worst yelling (and some said swearing) at a middle-aged woman who’d yelled at them (and supposedly called them “stupid”) for messing around while crossing the street.

She was white some of them were black. It got heated others on the sidewalk took sides.

This all occurred on Roland Avenue around 5 p.m. on a weeknight a couple of blocks from the boys’ school in between a Starbucks and Eddie’s grocery store. The area is a popular hangout spot for Roland Park middle schoolers as well as students from the area’s cluster of private schools and residents come and go on their way to pick up students or shop.

Meanwhile another middle-aged white woman walking two dogs came along and inserted herself into the mix. And what words did she have for the children?

Only one that mattered to onlookers: the N-word.

Think about that: An adult was apparently perfectly comfortable lobbing a racial slur into an argument with middle schoolers in front of other adults in the community.

With that one word she brought shame on herself and the whole area by extension. And she taught the students of Roland Park a devastating lesson on the cusp of Black History Month: You or your friends might not be safe here in the community your school is a part of.

A parent watching this unfold from her car texted a teacher who asked that parent to intervene. School administrators came outside and eventually the police arrived. The first woman had called them explaining to the intervening parent that she felt threatened that she was scared to walk to her car.

Perhaps that’s true or she felt it was.

But irrational fear of black children in white neighborhoods is also real. They’ve been profiled harassed and killed for simply existing where they’re not wanted. (The Greater Roland Park area is 83% white 7% black. Roland Park Elementary Middle School is 42% white and 38% black.)

Police handled the situation well the parent said and never had to involve the children. The slur-user had left by the time they arrived.

“We are disappointed our students were treated in such a manner and it is never appropriate to degrade any student with hateful language in any setting” School Principal Amanda Brown wrote in an email to parents last week alerting them to the incident. “I am reaching out to neighboring businesses and community leaders to discuss these events and how we can work together to support our kids and have a nurturing community moving forward.”

She urged parents to support the kids — all the kids — and respectfully engage with them. And we know there are many many area families who do lovingly. And we hope more will join them in getting to know the young people they see regularly.

We also know there are some folks annoyed by the students swarming the library and coffee shop who grumble about the foolishness of youth and it has nothing to do with race. No one’s trying to excuse the bad behavior of the boys. But that’s not the issue.

Adult racism is the issue. The N-word is the issue. The comfort of children in one of Baltimore’s most a

Auch in Frankreich wurden nun drei Fälle bekannt das Virus hat unseren Kontinent bereits erreicht.

Statt die Bevölkerung darüber zu informieren in welcher Form Schutzmaßnahmen getroffen werden können übt sich Gesundheitsminister Jens Spahn in Floskeln. Man solle einen „kühlen Kopf“ bewahren die hierzulande verbreitete Grippe fordere schließlich ebenfalls 20.000 Todesopfer im Jahr. Eine unglaubliche Verharmlosung! Stattdessen lobt Spahn die Informationspolitik Chinas möchte die neue Corona-Epidemie selbst aber lieber aussitzen durch Nichtstun. Wer sich auf der Homepage des Bundesministeriums für Gesundheit über das Virus informieren will findet dort nichts - obwohl der Erreger damals in der Variante MERS bereits 2015 eine Sterblichkeitsrate von 40 Prozent aufwies.

Der Umgang mit dem aktuellen Ausbruch zeigt das ganze Versagen Spahns und der Bundesregierung auf. Die Bevölkerung ist transparent darüber aufzuklären wie sie sich schützen kann. Die Homepage des Bundesgesundheitsministeriums muss als Informationsquelle dienen können wie sich die Bürger schützen und das Risiko einer Ansteckung reduzieren können. Darüber findet sich aber nichts! Es muss eine bessere Hygieneaufklärung betrieben werden. Zu thematisieren sind zwingend die Ausstattung in öffentlichen Räumen und am Arbeitsplatz Maskenempfehlung für erkrankte Menschen und Begrüßungsrituale. Mit letzteren muss in diesen Zeiten deutlich vernünftiger und selektiver umgegangen werden. Das übliche Aussitzen der Bundesregierung und Nichtstun wird hier nicht funktionieren.

THREE years in the making the Trump peace plan was finally unveiled this week. 

Crucially the so called “Deal of the Century” allows for the creation of a Palestinians state twice as large as the area Palestinians currently control with a capital in East Jerusalem. 

The agreement authorizes the formation of the Palestinian state in four years provided that Palestinians agree to stop supporting terrorism and disarm terrorist organizations Hamas and Islamic Jihad.

And so the Trump peace plan as predicted proposes a further division of the Land of Israel which is even now  comprised of only a fraction of the territory established in Scripture (Ex. 23:31-33).

It’s well documented how attempts by foreign leaders to change the borders of Israel have been met with disaster or loss in their own land. For instance in 2005 President George W. Bush pressured Israel to turn over all of Gaza to the Palestinians. On the day that the very last Jewish residents were evacuated from Gaza a storm named Katrina—which would become the costliest natural disaster in US history up until that time—started forming over the Bahamas. 

With the biblical principal that God judges those who divide His land in view (Joel 3:2) it’s more than a little uncanny that just two hours after Trump proposed giving parts of Israel to those who chant “Death to Israel” a massive 7.7 earthquake struck the Caribbean shaking buildings as far away as Florida’s east coast. 

According to the USGS website that tracks quakes and tremors people reported shaking from West Palm Beach down to the keys. 

West Palm Beach is home to Donald Trump’s famous Mar-a-Lago Club which he calls the “Southern White House” and has served as his and Melania’s primary residence since September 2019.

The 7.7 quake was one of the most powerful ever recorded in the Caribbean and the largest since 1946. 

That Florida was shaken is striking on its own because due to the fact that the Sunshine State is not located near any tectonic plate boundaries it rarely sees earthquakes. In fact Florida is tied for first place as having the fewest quakes of any state in the US. 

THE ULTIMATE DEAL OR THE ULTIMATE OFFENSE? 

If previous attempts to divide the Promised Land have been offensive to God the Deal of the Century—though viewed by pundits and politicians as favorable to Israel—is surely all the more.

Think about it. The Bible is chock full of signs and timelines that tell us when Jesus is returning i.e. 6000 years from Creation and one generation after the “fig-tree” nation (Israel) puts forth leaves  (Matt. 24:32-34 Ps. 90:10). 

Now that the time is clearly upon us the leader of the biggest Christian nation is facilitating what amounts to a “deal with the devil” that trades portions of God’s Land for a bogus promise of peace. 

Making it worse Israel’s current and potential prime ministers Netanyahu and Gantz are amenable to the plan assuming authority to give away land that Scripture says God is only “leasing” to them (Lev. 25:23).

Can you see how the Lord as patient and slow to anger as He is might be annoyed?

It will be interesting to see what happens in the US and Israel in coming weeks especially if the Deal of the Century gains traction.

Meanwhile other prophetic signs such as the burgeoning Coronavirus outbreak and a massive locust swarm in the Horn of Africa threaten financial markets and food supplies.

Jesus said He would return at a time when events are ramping up like birth pains (Matt. 24:8 1 Thess. 5:3).

It’s difficult to imagine things ramping up much more.

Pakistan Halts Investigation of “629 Brides” to China fearing Termination of Chinese Financial Help reports The Daily Guardian London - - -
By: Gholam Mujtaba M.S. M.D. Ed.D. FRSPH FICPS

As I mentioned in my previous post that the year 2020 augmented human sufferings in China. The state sponsored atrocity over fellow citizens of Muslim denomination in Xinjiang has been widely denounced. 
The United States and most western nations have vehemently condemned inhuman acts over minority Uighur Muslims.
In a current news report published in the British Daily The Guardian revealed that over 629 Pakistani brides were sold to China and the investigation to this crime was halted because of a fear of losing financial ties with Beijing. The news further discloses that Saleem Iqbal a Christian activist who helped parents rescue several young girls from China told AP that the government has put “immense pressure” on investigators.
The report further alleges that the biggest case against traffickers has fallen apart with a court in Faisalabad acquitting 31 Chinese nationals charged in connection with trafficking. Women who had initially been interviewed by police refused to testify after being threatened or bribed into silence according to a court official and a police investigator familiar with the case.

The leader of neighboring Pakistan showed ignorance over those atrocity while the outcry is heard thousands of miles away across the Atlantic.
Though this inhuman atrocity is unheard in Pakistan however contrary to this one wonders as to how the spread of Coronavirus is heard inside the borders of Islamabad?
The incumbents are primarily interested in seeking money. The quest for transparency after the alleged sale of brides and the sale of Gwader port has strengthened in Pakistan China relationship. 
Pakistan’s net foreign debt amounts to 128 billion dollars of which the Chinese loan amounts to 64 billion dollars. This includes the 58 billion dollars towards CPEC and roughly 6 billion dollars in 2019. No visible benefit to a common man has been observed in the CPEC nor the redundant nuclear arsenals have displayed any benefit in the occupied Kashmir.

A NEW CHALLENGE BEFORE PAKISTAN
Pakistan’s tilt towards China has damaged Pakistan-U.S. relationship. Pakistan Israel and Egypt benefited from this relation for decades but the Pakistani leadership deliberately changed the direction of Pakistan’s foreign policy.
Pakistani brides and their body organs are allegedly sold in China. The Uighur Muslims are faced with worst human atrocities whereas the Pakistani American community and Muslim Americans enjoy the best of the best in their adopted land.
The hostility and use of the controlled media targeting negative perceptions against the United States and staying MUM on Chinese human rights violations raise red flags.
This situation has provided room to India Pakistan’s longtime adversary to get closer to the United States. President Trump’s visit to New Delhi next month will bring bounties for India.

POINT TO PONDER
Who has benefited out of this situation?

There is a very low risk of contracting coronavirus. Send the kids to school!
Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses. They can cause diseases ranging from common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
Some human coronaviruses spread easily among people while others do not.
Your risk of serious illness may be higher if you have a weakened immune system. This may be the case for:
older people
people with chronic illness (such as diabetes cancer heart kidney or chronic lung disease)
symptoms
The symptoms range from common to severe respiratory diseases and include:
• fever
• a cough
• heavy breathing
• pneumonia and kidney failure

How to protect yourself
To reduce exposure and transmission of a wide range of diseases including coronaviruses you should follow the usual health precautions such as:
• Wash your hands frequently using a sanitizer
• Avoid contact with sick people
• cough and sneeze cover your mouth with a tissue use a mask to cover your mouth

If you are traveling to an area known to have coronaviruses remember:
• High risk areas such as farms live animal markets and areas where animals can be killed
• contact with animals (live or dead) including pigs chickens ducks and wild birds
• surfaces with animal droppings or secretions","108548603981694_127185555451332","RomskaKomunitaToronto"

Before everyone goes around calling me names and judging me remember that I’m here to remind everyone that if there’s a risk to something there should always be a choice. Making this decision isn’t “uneducated” or “lazy” or “neglectful” as a lot of people say. It’s actually a lot harder than if we just agreed and did what most people do. 

Things aren’t a one size fits all and parents should not be judged on making decisions that they believe are best for their children. Every single choice I’ve ever made for my child’s health has come from a lot of scientific education and scholarly research. If that wasn’t proof enough every single health professional who has met or examined my son has told me that he is and I quote “the healthiest child I have ever seen”. 

At one point I was just like the majority of people. What actually made me look into them more was when I was studying a bachelor of nursing and midwifery and I was curious to know more about them because we had next to no education about them aside from to encourage patientswomen to get them. 

I know this is long but it’s worth it. Read with an open mind and remember this is straight from the mouths of the professionals. 

The leading doctors and scientists around the globe met in Geneva Switzerland on December 2nd and 3rd for the Global Vaccine Summit. All of which was captured on security camera footage. 

A few key takeaways points from this conference were:
- Vaccines are not systemically safety tested.
- Vaccines are not effectively safety tested for maternal (pregnant) immunisation. 
- Misinformation is not Misinformation
- Doctors on the frontline are now questioning vaccine safety.
- The science and medical community simply dont know the potential long term side effects of mixing different vaccines (adjuvantsantigensmanufacturers) when administered at the same time (in different limbs).
- Multiple adjuvants increases the risk of an adverse event
- The W.H.O and C.D.C have been lying.

 Below are transcribed quotes that mildly cover the above points video in comments for anyone whos interested. 

Remember these are the leading professionals in the field (C.D.CW.H.OF.D.A) whom Id like to think are safe from Murdoch MediaGovernmentBig Pharma smear campaigns for speaking truths although most of this panel say something very different in the public space so I suspect this summit wasnt meant to be seen by the public.

Its also very important to understand that this is about vaccine safety not anti vaccine.

Dr Heidi Larson MA PhD
Anthropologist
Director of the Vaccine Confidence Program.

”We have a very wobbly health professional frontline that is starting to question vaccines and the safety of vaccines” 

“Most medical school curriculum even nursing curriculum in medical school youre lucky if you have a half day on vaccines never mind keeping up to date”

“Facebook WhatsApp Twitter Instagram WeChat Weibo they have a lot of fingers pointing at them to fix the misinformation problem but its not so simple one of the biggest problems is a lot of its not misinformation”

“We are in a unique position in human history where we shifted the human population to vaccine induced dependency on vaccine induced immunity” 

“Theres a lot of safety science that’s needed and without the good science we cant have good communication so although Im talking about all these other contextual issues and communication issues it absolutely needs the science its the backbone. You cant repurpose the same old science to make it sound better if you dont have the science thats relevant to the new problem. So we need much more investment in safety science”

“So I think vaccines regardless whether they are generated using new and innovative technology or whether more standard conventional technologies are applied they do require safety surveillance and monitoring that is specifically tailored to the vaccine that is under consideration”

Dr Martin Howell Friede
Coordinator Initiative for vaccine research W.H.O 

”When we add an adjuvant its because it is essential we do no add adjuvants to vaccines because we want to do so but when we add them it adds to the complexity and I give courses every year on how you develop vaccines and the first lesson is while you are you making a vaccine if you can avoid using an adjuvant please do so lesson two is use one that has a history of safety and lesson three is if youre not going to do that think very carefully“

The deadly new coronavirus outbreak remind us of SARS in 2003 started in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has entered the stage of transmission among families and hospital it is a full-blown community epidemic. We are all terrified because this new virus reminds us of how the Chinese government covered up the severity of SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome) which  infected 8098 people and took away 774 lives across 30 countries in 2003. 

In 2003 the outbreak of SARS was traced to the selling of wild animal like snakes civet cats and bats in wet markets in China’s Southern Guangdong province and the first patient was infected after preparing for a meal of chicken cat and snake and later infected others. During the initial stages of the outbreak the Chinese government concealed information from the public limiting mitigation efforts and exacerbating the spread of SARS.  

Chinese government did not notified the WHO of SARS until February 2003 allowing it to flourish and spread to Hong Kong infecting 1755 people and took away 299 lives. I was just a kid at the time I remember school was cancelled and I was staring at the news everyday for updates on infection and death numbers I can still recall how desperate we were.

Similar to SARS the Huanan Seafood Market which sells meat is sold alongside live animals like dogs hares and civets in Wuhan is thought to be the starting point for the virus outbreak. A week earlier Chinese government claimed the outbreak of the Wuhan-virus was “preventable and controllable” and this week it was forced to admit that the virus was able to spread person-to-person and there are cases of infection were reported by people who never set foot in Wuhan. However Chinese were being arrested by authorities and were accused of spreading rumours about the Wuhan-virus despite it was officially acknowledged. 

More worryingly the Chinese authorities have decided to shut down outbound transportation from Wuhan on Thursday morning citizens of Wuhan were rushing to leave the city by trains or airplanes to go to other cities or countries despite having fever or other symptoms of pneumonia suggesting a massive outbreak is imminent. 

There are cases of Wuhan-virus infection reported in Hong Kong Taiwan Singapore the US and France scientists suspected that there may be 1000 to 2300 actual infections since December 2019 which are significantly higher than those 550 confirmed cases released by Chinese government so far. It is very likely that the Chinese government attempts to cover up the Wuhan-virus. It is the most  irresponsible thing a government can do to its people and other states in the world. Lives of citizens and medical personnel are at stake because of the Chinese government’s attempt to cover up the severity of the virus instead of protecting them. 

It worries me to see this highly contagious Wuhan-virus have infected people in Europe and I fear there will be more cases after Lunar New Year as many Chinese students will travel back to Europe from China after the holidays increasing the risk of the virus being transmitted into Europe. 

To protect yourself and your community from this epidemic please wear a mask in public. The last thing I’d like to see is another similar outbreak of disease like SARS in anywhere in the world.","200976479994868_2752798434812647","joshuawongchifung"

Saya lebih memilih no comment saat ada yg bertanya tentang fenomena Wuhan Coronavirus. Kabar yg beredar sangat liar dan tak jelas sumbernya itu alasannya. Kecuali saya datang ke Wuhan langsung mungkin saya bisa menyampaikan komentar.

Satu hal saja bahwa saudara Muslim kita di Wuhan itu hanya maksimal 2% saja. Titik. 

Saya justru concern dengan fenomena Coronavirus di Xinjiang. Ya di Xinjiang juga telah terdampak virus tersebut. Saat ini sudah 3 orang yg korban. Otoritas provinsi sudah melakukan pembatasan perjalanan bagi penduduk. Liburan sekolah dan universitas diperpanjang. Dan serangkaian lain yg justru menarik.

Hal menarik adalah ketika saya dikabari oleh saudara Muslim Uyghur yg menerima surat cinta-Nya yg berbalut koran di Xinjiang bahwa di tengah KETEGANGAN mewabahnya Wuhan Coronavirus justru ada KETENANGAN. 

Dia dan keluarganya justru mendapatkan kesempatan lebih longgar untuk membaca Al Quran. Juga untuk shalat. Walaupun memang tidak di masjid. Karena kini masjid memiliki face recognizer lock yg wajah terdaftar saja yg boleh masuk dam shalat.

Sang pengawas yg tadinya full time mengawasi kegiatan ibadah masyarakat kini lebih sibuk memperhatikan virus.

THREE years in the making the Trump peace plan was finally unveiled this week. 

Crucially the so called “Deal of the Century” allows for the creation of a Palestinians state twice as large as the area Palestinians currently control with a capital in East Jerusalem. 

The agreement authorizes the formation of the Palestinian state in four years provided that Palestinians agree to stop supporting terrorism and disarm terrorist organizations Hamas and Islamic Jihad.

And so the Trump peace plan as predicted proposes a further division of the Land of Israel which is even now  comprised of only a fraction of the territory established in Scripture (Ex. 23:31-33).

It’s well documented how attempts by foreign leaders to change the borders of Israel have been met with disaster or loss in their own land. For instance in 2005 President George W. Bush pressured Israel to turn over all of Gaza to the Palestinians. On the day that the very last Jewish residents were evacuated from Gaza a storm named Katrina—which would become the costliest natural disaster in US history up until that time—started forming over the Bahamas. 

With the biblical principal that God judges those who divide His land in view (Joel 3:2) it’s more than a little uncanny that just two hours after Trump proposed giving parts of Israel to those who chant “Death to Israel” a massive 7.7 earthquake struck the Caribbean shaking buildings as far away as Florida’s east coast. 

According to the USGS website that tracks quakes and tremors people reported shaking from West Palm Beach down to the keys. 

West Palm Beach is home to Donald Trump’s famous Mar-a-Lago Club which he calls the “Southern White House” and has served as his and Melania’s primary residence since September 2019.

The 7.7 quake was one of the most powerful ever recorded in the Caribbean and the largest since 1946. 

That Florida was shaken is striking on its own because due to the fact that the Sunshine State is not located near any tectonic plate boundaries it rarely sees earthquakes. In fact Florida is tied for first place as having the fewest quakes of any state in the US. 

THE ULTIMATE DEAL OR THE ULTIMATE OFFENSE? 

If previous attempts to divide the Promised Land have been offensive to God the Deal of the Century—though viewed by pundits and politicians as favorable to Israel—is surely all the more.

Think about it. The Bible is chock full of signs and timelines that tell us when Jesus is returning i.e. 6000 years from Creation and one generation after the “fig-tree” nation (Israel) puts forth leaves  (Matt. 24:32-34 Ps. 90:10). 

Now that the time is clearly upon us the leader of the biggest Christian nation is facilitating what amounts to a “deal with the devil” that trades portions of God’s Land for a bogus promise of peace. 

Making it worse Israel’s current and potential prime ministers Netanyahu and Gantz are amenable to the plan assuming authority to give away land that Scripture says God is only “leasing” to them (Lev. 25:23).

Can you see how the Lord as patient and slow to anger as He is might be annoyed?

It will be interesting to see what happens in the US and Israel in coming weeks especially if the Deal of the Century gains traction.

Meanwhile other prophetic signs such as the burgeoning Coronavirus outbreak and a massive locust swarm in the Horn of Africa threaten financial markets and food supplies.

Jesus said He would return at a time when events are ramping up like birth pains (Matt. 24:8 1 Thess. 5:3).

It’s difficult to imagine things ramping up much more.","743728535_10157777365903536","gwendolyn.m.morton"

The United States should be concerned about China’s ability to redirect ‘enormous resources’ to strategic fields a chief at Google says.
U.S. News & World Report
By Sintia Radu Staff Writer - Jan. 31 2020
The Global Supercomputer Race

The United States should be concerned about Chinas ability to pour enormous resources into developing powerful supercomputers the head of quantum computing at Google warns.

Just days after officials in China announced the completion of building in a single week a new hospital for patients infected with the coronavirus and begin building a second one Google engineering director Hartmut Neven warned that the Asian giants ability to quickly devote massive resources to a single task poses a new technological challenge to the U.S. and other countries. Speaking at an event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington D.C. Neven who is tasked at Google with researching and developing the worlds fastest supercomputers says the Chinese might soon make tremendous progress that could compromise the U.S. leadership position in this field.

We are indeed most worried (about) an unknown competitor out of China to beat us in the race to (such a) machine because China as a society just has the ability to steer enormous resources in the directions that are deemed strategically important Neven says.

Quantum computing employs quantum mechanics to bring huge leaps forward in processing power. While no country has yet developed such a fully operational machine China does not have facilities equivalent to the U.S. laboratories researching and testing quantum computers – but they will get there Neven adds.

They plan to have three different labs and they will actually all be devoted to quantum information (the science at the core of building quantum computers).

In addition to fifth-generation and artificial intelligence quantum computing is another area of technological competition between countries and one in which the U.S. and China are competing to be the worlds leader. The global quantum-computing market is estimated to reach $948.82 million by 2025 and such technology could be a game changer in many industries.

Developing quantum computers will bring tremendous advantages to various industries experts say as these super fast computers will be able to tackle very complex calculations that todays computers cannot handle. Quantum computers could process never-before-seen amounts of data which can lead to more efficient communication between devices and a boost for overall innovation.

For example analyzing large medical datasets could bring about more accurate diagnostics and facilitate more efficient drug development. Quantum computers also could help find the optimal configuration for chemical reactions increase the accuracy of weather prediction and help governments better predict and fight against cyberthreats.

Several countries are in this race. President Donald Trump signed a bill in 2018 that officially earmarked $1.2 billion for quantum information development in the next decade. Last year Google claimed it overtook Chinese efforts and developed a machine that can solve a problem in just 200 seconds which would take a supercomputer today about 10000 years.

Canada Germany the United Kingdom France Russia Japan and South Korea are also looking into the supercomputers of tomorrow and pouring large sums of money into research and development.

According to Neven the U.S. is still the leader in quantum-computing research but as is the custom in Silicon Valley companies are constantly worried about competitors and watching closely any developments overseas.

In Silicon Valley we say only the paranoid survive so theres always a hit list of your biggest worries he says.

Medical doctor trainees of the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) has taken lead in producing a cure and vaccine for the deadly coronavirus.

The students of the College of Health Sciences of JKUAT has successfully created and tested a Coronavirus vaccine.

The 7-mmeber medical student team from JKUAT completed works on the vaccine last week and shipped samples to China over the weekend. Reports from China indicate that six patients who were administered with the vaccines have shown rapid signs of recovery.
The students told the press that two of them were in China on an exchange program when the first case of the virus infection was reported. They collected samples of the virus from China to their laboratory on campus.

Professor Moses Yumbya who supervised the students told the press that rabbits who were intentionally infected recovered after the vaccine was administered. “All tests were negative” Prof Moses said.

The team is expected to head to China tonight to assist in mass production of the vaccine to help fight the deadly virus

Defend the Defenders January 31 2020

Authorities in many Vietnamese localities have imposed financial penalties on four local residents who have reportedly posted “fake information” about the novel Coronavirus infection on social media.

According to the state-controlled media Facebookers Ha Thi Le Nhan from the central city of Hue Tran Van Tung from the southern province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau Tran Thi Thu Thuy from the northernmost province of Lang Son and Vu Thi Thanh from the northern city of Haiphong were summoned to by the local police for interrogation about their posts on Coronavirus infection in their areas.

Newspapers also reported that the four Facebookers admitted that their posts were untrue. Police in their localities have proposed administrative fines of between 10 million ($430) and VND15 million.

Particularly Mr. Tung was fined with VND15 million Ms. Nhan and Ms. Thuy were punished with VND12.5 million while Ms. Thanh has to pay VND10 million.

They were requested to delete their posts and will face heavier penalties including arrest and charge with criminal offenses if they repeat.

Nhan was said to have posted on her Facebook account that “Hue has detected one nCoV infection case. The patient a Chinese national from Wuhan is now quarantined at Hue Central Hospital.” She reportedly also posted the same information on several Facebook groups.

In the same move Tung posted on Facebook on January 27 “Le Loi Hospital in Vung Tau Town capital of Ba Ria-Vung Tau is putting two Chinese in quarantine as they are suspected to have been infected with the new coronavirus.”

As for Thanh she wrote on her own Facebook account on Sunday that “One suspected Wuhan pneumonia infection case has been found in Haiphong and the patient is now quarantined at Viet Tiep Hospital.”

All of them were said to keep their posts shortly and deleted them later but the local police said their information has already caused confusion among many people.

Meanwhile Vietnam has confirmed five cases of nCoV infection as of January 31. They are two Chinese citizens and three Vietnamese residents coming back from Wuhan. One of the Chinese had recovered.

The nation had 97 suspected cases with symptoms like fever and cough and is quarantining 32 pending test results.

Many experts predicted that Vietnam may be the nation suffered most from the Coronavirus epidemic after China where the disease broke and took lives of 231 people and infected more than 7000.

Vietnam’s communist government is considering to declare a national emergency in a bid to deal with the outbreak. As many as 500000 Chinese citizens thousands of them from Wuhan the epicenter of the epidemic were reportedly to enter Vietnam during the Lunar New Year festival which lasted one week until January 29.

Instead of providing transparent information about Coronavirus infection in localities Vietnam’s central government and local authorities are striving to hide all information regarding the disease and suppress bloggers and Facebookers.

Vietnam has around 50 million Internet users however the country is listed at the bottom of Internet freedom according to Freedom House’s 2019 report. Last year at least 21 Facebookers were sentenced to between one year and 11 years in prison for their online posts.

Kepada yth Presiden Republik Indonesia jokowi 
.
Coronavirus yang melanda dunia saat ini cikal bakalnya diduga dari kebiasaan warga Wuhan - Tiongkok yang mengkonsumsi hewan liar yang tak layak dimakan.
.
Dari wabah mengerikan ini kita bisa liat bagaimana kebiasaan buruk segelintir orang menjadi petaka dasyat seluruh dunia.
.
Negara-negara sekitar langsung membuat regulasi resmi dengan membuat Undang Undang yang melarang warganya memakan daging anjing dan kucing untuk mengantisipasi adanya wabah lain semisal rabies.
.
Lah di Indonesia khususnya Solo kota kelahiran Pak jokowi ternyata dapat dengan mudah loh ditemukan warung2 pinggir jalan yang menjajakan masakan daging anjing.
.
Apa Pak jokowi ga takut rakyat yang bapak cintai bisa berpotensi terkena wabah rabies? Ataukah pemerintah kita seperti yang sudah-sudah dan menjadi ciri khas negara kita yang harus menunggu petaka dasyat datang baru bertindak? Bukankah mencegah jauh lebih bijak dari mengobati? 
.
Sekali lagi kami mohon dengan sangat Bapak Presiden Republik Indonesia jokowi  untuk berpikir secara bijak mengenai kesehatan dan kesejahteraan masyarakat yang mencintai bapak yang bisa berpotensi menjadi korban hanya karena kebiasaan segelintir masyarakat yang mengkonsumsi daging anjing dan kucing dan negara justru membiarkan kondisi ini.
.
Bapak jokowi ga mau kan wabah rabies melanda rakyat yang sudah mati2an berjuang agar bapak terpilih kedua kali memimpin negara ini?
.
Salam sayang dari salah satu rakyat bapak yang dari 2014 lalu berjuang dengan caranya sendiri agar bapak menjadi presiden kami. CJP
.
.
PS:
Untuk fans garis keras Pak jokowi please gw jangan dibully gw hanya ingin menyampaikan aspirasi gw sebagai rakyat jelata ?","558557421193759_VK_1012935229089307","yayasansaranamettaindonesia"

As the CSIRO powers ahead in its mission of providing a vaccine to control the spread of coronavirus let it be remembered that successive Coalition governments have imposed savage budget cuts on this essential organisation resulting in job losses. They did not like the science. They ignored facts as being inconvenient. And now they are hugely in its debt.

Non-emergency man?
The magic words of Christmas Island have caused Peter Dutton to rematerialise and come out with an announcement about keeping Australians safe from coronavirus. It is a good excuse to use the refugee facility that has cost his government so much.

But where was Mr Dutton who is responsible for emergency management (part of his Home Affairs portfolio) during the entire bushfire crisis over the past four months? Not a peep. It is clear that his view of keeping Australians safe does not extend to anything remotely connected to climate change or the devastating bushfires and he does not take seriously his actual responsibility for emergency management.

Don Vincent North Warrandyte
I cannot believe what Kerri Sackville said about having to bring up a 12-year-old daughter on her own. She has two older children who should be able to assist. My wife as a 12 or 13-year-old and the eldest of three children had to spend her time after school and Saturday mornings cooking doing the laundry and cleaning the house because her mother (a single parent because of previous family violence) had to work.

Yes it prevailed in the 40s. Ms Sackville should make her children share the load.

David Hudd Mornington

Very little gospel truth
I had to smile at Lance Sterlings comment (Letters 301) that no concession is given to metaphor hyperbole or cultural context when one adopts a literal reading of the Bible. A more pertinent point is that the Bible and particularly the gospels contains so many internal contradictions and obvious errors that nothing in it should be relied upon as gospel truth.

Brian Kilday Jeeralang Junction

A one-sided peace plan
Donald Trumps latest foray into stirring up trouble in the very troubled Middle East is no genuine peace plan for resolving the festering sore of the PalestineIsrael issue. To borrow one of his favourite expressions it is a total fake. It seeks to normalise the occupation of much of the Palestinian West Bank in countless settler settlements that now criss-cross the West Bank and which are out of bounds for Palestinians.

Trump wants to legitimise the unjust occupation and oppression of the Palestinian people and in reality destroy any real chance of two self-governing and independent states of Israel and Palestine.

BY SCOTT KITCHINGJANUARY 31 2020 2:58PMScottKitching

Provincial health officials say a Londoner who recently travelled to China has tested positive for novel coronavirus.

Dr. David Williams chief medical officer of health for Ontario made the announcement at a news conference on Friday afternoon. The Londoner is the third confirmed case in Ontario and the fourth in Canada.

The case involves a female student at Western University who travelled to China. According to Dr. Chris Mackie CEO and medical officer of health at the Middlesex London Health Unit the woman in her 20s wore a mask for her entire trip from Wuhan China back to London. When she returned to Canada on January 23 she was not symptomatic. However she developed symptoms the next day and was assessed at the London Health Sciences Centre. Her symptoms were mild and she recovered within three days.

“LHSC’s Emergency Department team took the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of other patients visitors staff and physicians” said Dr. Michael Payne medical director infection prevention and control LHSC. “Our highly skilled medical staff were ready for the presentation of coronavirus and demonstrated the effectiveness of our precautions practices and protocols.”

According to Dr. Mackie the student has not been on campus since returning to Canada and the risk to the community is extremely low.

“There was so little virus in here sputum sample that her initial lab results were negative” Mackie said in a tweet on Friday afternoon.

Mackie said the woman stayed in isolation even after the initial negative lab results. She is still in isolation despite her recovery.","112073300343001_VK_119739382709250",

Las principales aerolíneas estadounidenses cancelan los vuelos a China mientras el gobierno toma medidas

ESTADOS UNIDOS 31 ENE 2020 - Las tres principales aerolíneas estadounidenses anunciaron la cancelación de vuelos a China continental el viernes después de que el Departamento de Estado de EE. UU. Elevó un aviso de viaje sobre las preocupaciones sobre el coronavirus.

El trío de compañías aéreas United Airlines Holdings Inc Delta Air Lines Inc y American Airlines Group Inc ya se habían movido para reducir los vuelos a China en medio de una fuerte caída en la demanda a medida que el virus se propaga.

Sus anuncios del viernes se produjeron antes de una llamada con funcionarios estadounidenses para discutir los vuelos.

United y Delta dijeron que continuarían operando vuelos de ida hasta el 5 y el 3 de febrero respectivamente. United la aerolínea más grande de EE. UU. 

Mientras tanto American dijo que estaba deteniendo todos los vuelos continentales desde el viernes hasta el 27 de marzo pero que continuaría volando a Hong Kong.

La administración Trump estaba considerando nuevas restricciones pero aún no estaba claro si seguiría adelante. Algunos funcionarios de las aerolíneas se preocuparon de que si no detenían voluntariamente los vuelos esto provocaría que el gobierno tomara medidas formales lo que podría complicar la reanudación de los vuelos posteriores.

Estados Unidos les dijo a los ciudadanos el jueves que no viajen a China debido a la epidemia que ha infectado a casi 10000 personas y ha sido declarada una emergencia global.

La tripulación de la aerolínea instó a los transportistas a detener los vuelos al país con los pilotos de American presentando una demanda el jueves en busca de una detención inmediata y el sindicato que representa a las azafatas de Delta y United exigiendo una decisión clara del gobierno de EE. UU.

United dijo que suspendería sus vuelos a Beijing Chengdu y Shanghai hasta el 28 de marzo pero que continuaría operando un vuelo diario entre San Francisco y Hong Kong.

La suspensión de Delta debía durar hasta el 30 de abril.

Las acciones de las aerolíneas estadounidenses han registrado grandes pérdidas esta semana por la preocupación del impacto financiero del virus.

Otras aerolíneas que han detenido sus vuelos a China continental incluyen Air France KLM SA British Airways Lufthansa de Alemania y Virgin Atlantic.

Las principales aerolíneas chinas todavía operaban vuelos hacia y desde los Estados Unidos.","295922857118229_2770695936307563","miperiodico.com.ar"

Okay reposting this info with my update below )

I found these Stats in a Comment and had to repost it for Perspective as you will read below... I feel bad because I cant find the name of the Gentleman who posted the Comment...

Coronavirus
Lets put this in perspective
There are over 1.4 BILLION people in China
• Over 40000 babies are born every DAY
• 30000 people die every DAY in China
• 4500 of these people die from pollution - per day
• 270 people die every day of infectious diseases - yes in China alone
And yet people are losing their minds over these 26 deaths since the first hospitalization 28 days ago.
In those 28 days - 840000 Chinese passed away. 7560 of them to INFECTIOUS DISEASES and yet this virus (for which a vaccine is due to be released) is causing utter mayhem.
• The deaths are mainly elderly men the median age being 75
• According to WHO statistics the life expectancy at birth for males in China is 75 years of age
Just think about it.....okay. Updated There have now been on 131 = 213 deaths in China you can track the biohazard event yourself on this global map. I will post direct link for you to Wuhan itself but Japan and Korea both have red biohazard alerts compared to this level yellow concern from a country that manufactures most flu vaccines for export. Just sayin.

Given the worrisome increase of the new China virus Chinese financial firms aim to combat this growing malign with more vigor and conditions taking a cue from the SARS outbreak which occurred nearly two decades ago.

With the markets to reopen next week traders are set to work shifts and sales staff working restricted to online-only pitches.

Banks and brokers will also be paying double next week for the essential staff in financial capital Shanghai who will be working from Monday when markets reopen after the extended Lunar New Year holiday the banks stated.

China’s stock and bond markets are the second-largest in the world with equities trading in Shanghai averaging 222.9 billion yuan ($32.29 billion) a day in 2019 and the interbank bond market averaging 836 billion yuan according to the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the central bank respectively.

Mainland markets were due to reopen on Friday following a week-long break but the holiday was extended to Monday by central government officials in an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus that has so far killed more than 200.

Bank compliance rules mean that while staff such as analysts can work from home traders must work from the office using secure internal systems.

The Shanghai government has told companies not to allow workers back before Feb. 9. Banks however are deemed to be providing an essential service and are required to re-open nationwide on Monday and staff called to work must be paid double on holidays.

China Construction Bank (CCB) the country’s second largest lender and Hang Seng Bank are among those planning to split their trading teams and alternate their working days according to three sources.

HSBC is also considering a shift system for trading teams that have to be in the office according to one source.

CCB and HSBC did not respond to requests for comment specifically on their trading plans. Hang Seng bank confirmed it would arrange trading shifts and would tell other staff where possible to work from home.

The People’s Bank of China and the Shanghai Stock Exchange did not respond immediately to a request for comment due to the holiday.

China’s new virus belongs to the same coronavirus family as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which also originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003.

A fund manager at the investment arm of the People’s Insurance Company (Group) of China said the virus wouldn’t deter people from trading when the market opens.

“People in the market are eager to trade. It’s about making money and you’re disadvantaged if others trade but you don’t” the manager stated.

China Asset Management Co Ltd said its fund managers are required to work from the office to meet compliance rules.

One member of its marketing team said the company would use online marketing rather than physical roadshows to promote new products in the near-term.","100027936341946_483626742578533","armiyau.shuaibu.79"

Im not even religious but Im really praying that something out there is watching over all the nurses doctors police and other staff at Arrowe Park hospital as all the Coronavirus Quarantine patients are due to touch down soon in the northwest. 

According to news sources: Over 100 potential patients with the deadly strain of coronavirus are on the way. The nurses and staff had little to no warning about the impending convoy on the way Lets hope that this doesnt become ground zero for one of the biggest fastest spreading epidemics in modern-day UK  Britain.

This will be the time we learn just how important it is to fund our NHS properly and if we all get out of this fine. Then the caring overworked dedicated and life-saving nurses doctors police (who are maintaining security at the location) deserve a raise!
_____________________________________________________

????Please remember the following:????
Control the environment and risk factors Control the symptoms You in turn can control the infection.

1. Avoid close contact with people who are sick not just from potential Wuhan but those who are sick in general.

2. Stay at home from work and school if you get sick or suspect you are getting sick from a viral or bacterial infection and limit how often you leave your home so you do not infect others even if you suspect youre ill.

3. Stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone too. (Your fever should be gone or going without using fever-reducing treatments If not then CALL your Doctors do not go in at current as many practitioners are asking those with viral infections to call before going in this is to control the environment and risk factors!)

4. Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze Throw the tissues straight away failing this cough into your elbow or hands and while you do not touch anything which doesnt need to be touched  Use soap and warm water to wash your hands failing this use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if you have it.

5. Do not under any circumstances if you are coughed or sneezed on touch your eyes nose and mouth Wash your hands as advised above.

Otherwise you can use google to recommend ways to stay hygienic Remember just because its not Wuhan doesnt mean its not viral and right now with the rise in concerns for Wuhan and Psnumonia in some locations. 
Its best to play it as safe as possible not just for your safety but for others too!

In response to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV during the Chinese New Year Feng Chia University established an emergency response team on 23rd Jan with President Lee as the general director and held two meetings on the 28th and 30th Jan to discuss campus epidemic prevention measures. The universitys emergency response team resolved the following important matters:

1. The University will resume operations on 3rd February (Monday) as scheduled but the Chinese New Year celebration gathering will be postponed.

2. According to the Central Epidemic Command Center ’s announcement on 29th Jan: To minimize the risk of infection it is recommended that students and staff who visited China Hong Kong and Macau should stay at home for 14 days. The affected staff are requested to inform the supervisor of the affiliated unit and conduct health observation at home. The way to work at home during this period will be notified later.

3. In addition to the above condition if our staff had contacted relatives and friends who returned from China Hong Kong and Macau during the vacation and have upper respiratory symptoms or fever please inform the supervisor of the affiliated unit. Please go back to work only after fully recovered. 

4. In order to minimize the risk of infection our University is currently requesting the Ministry of Education to agree to postpone the Classes start day to 2nd March. After the Ministry of Education agrees we will officially announce the revised Academic Calendar. 

5. The Academic Affairs Office has drawn up the measures for “students to study at ease”. Regarding registrations and payments course selections and real-time online teachings there will be flexible measures in response to the epidemic situation. The official announcement will be followed later.

6. The Student Affairs Office has purchased epidemic prevention supplies such as masks dry hand cleaners forehead thermometers 75% alcohol and automatic alcohol disinfection machines. They will be placed at various hotspots and the entrances of different buildings.

7. The Human Resources Office (https:bit.ly2vDJFuu) and the Academic Affairs Office (https:bit.ly2vBae3j) are currently investigating the contact history of the universitys staff and students in accordance with point 2. Please cooperate with the procedure.

Información tomada de reuters.com

Tracy Rucinski Laurence Frost.

Chicago  Paris (Reuters) - Los pilotos y las azafatas están exigiendo a las aerolíneas que detengan los vuelos a China ya que los funcionarios de salud declaran una emergencia mundial por el rápido virus de la corona y los pilotos de American Airlines presentan una demanda en busca de una detención inmediata.

China ha reportado casi 10000 casos y 213 muertes pero el virus se ha extendido a 18 países principalmente presumiblemente por pasajeros de aerolíneas.

Estados Unidos ha aconsejado a sus ciudadanos que no viajen a China elevando su advertencia al mismo nivel que los de Irak y Afganistán.

Las aerolíneas estadounidenses que han estado reduciendo los vuelos a China esta semana estaban reevaluando los planes de vuelo como resultado según personas familiarizadas con el asunto.

Es posible que la Casa Blanca pueda optar por tomar más medidas para prohibir los vuelos a China en los próximos días pero las autoridades destacaron que no se ha tomado una decisión.

La Asociación de Pilotos Aliados (APA por sus siglas en inglés) que representa a los pilotos de American Airlines citó serias y en muchos aspectos aún desconocidas las amenazas a la salud planteadas por el coronavirus en una demanda presentada en Texas donde se encuentra la aerolínea.

American dijo que estaba tomando precauciones contra el virus pero que no tenía comentarios inmediatos sobre la demanda. El miércoles anunció cancelaciones de vuelos desde Los Ángeles a Beijing y Shanghai pero continúa con los vuelos desde Dallas.

El presidente de la APA Eric Ferguson instó a los pilotos asignados a vuelos entre Estados Unidos y China a rechazar la asignación. En un comunicado el sindicato de asistentes de vuelo de American Airlines dijo que apoyaban la demanda de los pilotos e instó a la compañía y al gobierno de los Estados Unidos a errar por precaución y detener todos los vuelos hacia y desde China.

Los pilotos de United Airlines la aerolínea más grande de EE. UU. A China preocupados por su seguridad podrán abandonar su viaje sin pago según un memorando del miércoles de su sindicato a los miembros.

United anunció el jueves otras 332 cancelaciones de vuelos entre Estados Unidos y China entre febrero y el 28 de marzo aunque continuará operando vuelos de ida y vuelta desde San Francisco a Beijing Shanghai y Hong Kong.

La demanda de pilotos de American Airlines se produjo cuando un número cada vez mayor de líneas aéreas detuvo sus vuelos a China continental incluidas Air France KLM SA British Airways Lufthansa de Alemania y Virgin Atlantic.

Otros transportistas importantes han seguido volando a China pero las máscaras protectoras y las escalas más cortas diseñadas para reducir la exposición han hecho poco para tranquilizar a las tripulaciones.

CUENTA REGRESIVA

Una azafata estadounidense que aterrizó recientemente en una de las principales ciudades chinas dijo que una gran preocupación es contraer el virus y transmitirlo a las familias o quedar en cuarentena durante una escala ”. No entendí la gravedad de la situación hasta que fui allí ”Ella dijo bajo condición de anonimato describiendo la paranoia general en el vuelo de regreso con cada pasajero usando una máscara.

Ahora siento que estoy en una cuenta regresiva de 14 días.

Thai Airways está lavando sus cabinas con spray desinfectante entre los vuelos de China y permitiendo que la tripulación use máscaras y guantes.

Delta Air Lines opera menos vuelos y ofrece entregas de alimentos para que la tripulación pueda permanecer en sus hoteles. El transportista también está permitiendo que los pilotos abandonen los viajes a China sin paga según un memorando de su sindicato a los miembros.

Korean Air Lines Co Ltd y Singapore Airlines están enviando tripulación adicional para volar cada avión de regreso evitando pernoctaciones.

La aerolínea surcoreana también dijo que estaba cargando trajes protectores para los auxiliares de vuelo que podrían necesitar atender casos sospechosos de coronavirus en el aire.

Las aerolíneas en Asia están viendo una gran caída en las reservas junto con cancelaciones forzadas debido al brote de coronavirus dijo el jefe del arrendador de aviones Avolon Holdings Ltd y agregó que el impacto podría durar algunos meses.

El brote representa la mayor amenaza epidémica para la industria de las aerolíneas desde la crisis del SARS de 2003 que condujo a una caída del 45% en la demanda de pasajeros en Asia en su apogeo en abril de ese año dijeron analistas.

Fitch Ratings dijo que las aerolíneas con una exposición más moderada a China y la región de Asia y el Pacífico probablemente podrían volver a desplegar capacidad en rutas alternativas para mitigar el e

The patient a man from Wuhan in China flew to Melbourne from Guandong on 19 January. He is now being treated in isolation in hospital in Victoria. Authorities are tracing and contacting all passengers who travelled on the same flight to Melbourne and anyone he has been in contact with since.

As previously advised by the Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy it was always expected that Australia would see cases of this virus. 

The Australian Government has already enacted new measures to protect Australians. From today anyone arriving in Australia on flights from other parts of China will be met and provided instructions on what to do if they have symptoms or start to develop them.

Australians are being strongly advised not to travel to Wuhan or the Hubei Province in China. Chinese authorities have also imposed travel restrictions in at least five cities in the Hubei province. Australians travelling to these areas may not be able to leave until restrictions are lifted.

I am receiving daily briefings from health authorities and the Chief Medical Officer and we will continue to monitor and take action where necessary.

ADDRESS BY THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES REP. FEMI GBAJABIAMILA ON THE RESUMPTION OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE 2020 LEGISLATIVE SESSION ON THE 28TH OF JANUARY 2020.

PROTOCOLS

Good morning honourable colleagues. I welcome you all back to the chambers after the Christmas and New Year holidays and I thank you all for being here this morning. Though the House has not been in session these past few weeks I am aware that for many of us the work has never stopped and the obligations we hold have not been any less demanding. Still I hope that you have taken time to rest to recover and to prepare yourselves for the responsibilities that will continue to demand our time our abilities and our continued efforts.

Yesterday we stood to observe a moment’s silence in memory of our colleague Hon. Muhammadu Fagen-Gawo who passed away recently. My dear colleagues this 9th House of Representatives has in its very short lifetime suffered the loss of too many of our members. I am deeply troubled by this development. Yes it is God who gives life and it is God who takes life. We will not question the decisions of our maker. Nonetheless allow me to say once more as I have said before in this chamber that faithful execution of the responsibilities of our office requires of us that we pay close attention to our personal health. This is still very true. Beyond the obligations of our office we have other responsibilities as fathers and mothers brothers and sisters sons and daughters that require us to take matters of our personal health with the utmost care. Let us never lose sight of this fact. And may God guide protect and keep us all in good health and good fortune.

Upon the inauguration of this 9th House of Representatives in June 2019 we hit the ground running working with the executive and engaging the citizens of our country to discover and present solutions to the problems of our country. Some of our efforts have already yielded positive results in certain regards and I am hopeful that we will continue in this new year to meet and exceed the standards that we have set for ourselves.

For the first time since 1999 we have a budget passed by the legislature and signed into law before the start of the implementation year. I commend and thank all the members of this House for your efforts towards achieving early passage of the Appropriation Act 2020 and the Finance Act both of which have now been signed into law by His Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari GCFR. Honourable colleagues passing the budget into law is merely the beginning. We now have a duty to ensure faithful compliance with the letter and spirit of the law by the ministries departments and agencies (MDAs) of the Federal Government. We will carry out this responsibility and we will do so with integrity taking pains to ensure that we leave no room for neither friends nor foes to find fault with our words or deeds.

That Appropriation Act reflects the priorities of this government. These priorities are the same today as they have always been to develop public infrastructure to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population to facilitate investment in new and existing industries to provide educational opportunities for all our people and build an economy that allows every citizen to achieve their just ambitions. Our role as legislators is to ensure that the agencies responsible for implementing this budget maintain fidelity to these priorities. We will not be afraid to hold people’s feet to the fire where necessary. Where it is required of us that we act to review and update legislation we will do so too. We will not act alone we will not be arbitrary in our interventions. We will seek collaboration as a matter of course so that our interventions do not exacerbate existing problems or create new ones.

In this new year this House will further take all necessary action to pass into law the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) and to implement the much needed and long-delayed reforms of the sector. It is an unavoidable truth that the oil and gas industry is integral to the economic life of Nigeria. Achieving efficient operation in this sector is therefore a matter of national survival. We cannot allow these much-needed and too long-delayed reforms to continue to be hostage to the privileged interests of a few or the myopic considerations of those whose interests are served by the status quo. We will seek reform we will achieve reform and we will do so in collaboration with the executive with stakeholders in the industry and with those communities that most directly bear the highest costs of our exploration and sale of fossil fuels.

In 2019 the House of Representatives led interventions to address the challenges faced by the less abled amongst our citizens. We observed the International Day of People with Disabilities with an event here in the National Assembly which was intended first to

By L.R.O.N. News at San Jose CA U.S. 08:25AM 01.31.2020

Since 2003 the world has faced three outbreaks caused by coronaviruses — Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and now the current outbreak caused by a virus known as 2019-nCoV.

Scientists have yet to find a way to stop these outbreaks before they start. But over the past 17 years they have drastically shortened the time it takes to develop a vaccine after a new virus emerges.

This is largely due to technological advances and a greater commitment by governments and nonprofits to funding research on emerging infectious diseases.

Scientists are already racing to develop a vaccine for 2019-nCoV — a feat that experts say is technically possible but still may not come in time to help during this outbreak.

Faster vaccine development
Science news reports that several groups started working on a vaccine for 2019-nCoV shortly after Chinese scientists shared the virus’s genetic sequence in an online public database on Jan. 10.

Three of these groups are funded by Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) a nonprofit formed in 2017 to fund vaccine development for emerging infectious diseases.

Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Moderna Inc. both say they will have a vaccine ready for testing in animals in one month.

Moderna which is working with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases estimates that it could have a vaccine ready for a phase one clinical trial in people in three months.

Moderna and Inovio are both using a newer vaccine technology based on specific DNA or messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences of the virus. The chosen sequence codes for a viral protein such as one on the surface of the virus.

This type of vaccine can still elicit a protective immune response in a person. But because the protein is only a small piece of the virus it doesn’t cause illness.

Scientists using this method can also start designing a vaccine as soon as they have the virus’s genetic sequence. With other methods they would need to work with actual virus samples in the lab.

“The nice thing about this technology is that it bypasses many of the traditional steps to vaccine discovery and development. So it’s very fast” said Dr. Jon Andrus adjunct professor of global vaccinology and vaccine policy at the Milken Institute School of Public Health of George Washington University.

The third group at the University of Queensland in Australia is aiming to have a vaccine ready for testing in people in 16 weeks. They are developing a vaccine by growing viral proteins in cell cultures.

Drugmaker Johnson and Johnson which is not funded by CEPI started working on a vaccine two weeks ago according to CNBC. The company’s chief scientific officer estimates they could have a vaccine ready for market within a year.

Clinical trials are “rate-limiting” step
Dr. Stanley Perlman a professor of microbiology and immunology and pediatrics at the University of Iowa said these rapid timelines may be “feasible” for development of the vaccine. But they may be too fast for careful evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines.

Still “the platforms being used to develop these vaccines have been tested before so are likely to be as safe as when used previously” said Perlman. “Given the urgency of preventing further spread of the virus this rapid pace is understandable.”

Once scientists have created potential candidates the vaccines still have to go through animal testing and small and large clinical trials in people. These stages are needed to make sure the vaccines work and are safe.

Dr. Peter Hotez professor and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development said you can only speed up animal and clinical trials so much.

“In the end these steps take time” he said. “So that’s going to be the rate-limiting step in determining whether there’s going to be a vaccine available in time for this epidemic.”

Hotez said there are some things you can do to make this testing go a little faster like running some of the clinical trials in parallel. “But in the end you’re still talking weeks to months” he said.

Vaccinating people at high risk
During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak it took about 20 months for a vaccine to be ready for testing in people.

By then the outbreak had been contained with public health measures like isolating infected people setting up quarantines and identifying people who have come in contact with those who are sick.

These steps are already being done in the current outbreak. Whether these can contain 2019-nCoV depends on many factors some of which are still unknown — like how quickly the virus spreads and how serious

And just excited to be back and on the cusp of seeing my little Filipino family again.  

In the morning I loaded up student boxes with graded assignments then crashed the party of our current class of PhD students in their seminar introducing myself to the new enrollees and received the joyous welcome of the old timers.

Our PhD program is thriving not only with 15 or so students engaged in that particular seminar in sitio but several video-ed in from around the world.  This is an exciting place to be.  

Precisely at 9:30 District Superintendent Mark Eugenio picked me up and drove me the three hours to Taal the location of one of the recently locked-down communities just south of the recent erupting Taal Volcano. Along the way we picked up Pastor Bong former District Superintendent.   

What a happy reunion with my Filipino family!  My wife had spent the previous three days cleaning up the premises of our house from the mounds of volcano ash which had inundated the community for two weeks.  She had purchased a high power water spray that she used in washing off the roof and tiled areas and is now loaning it out to our neighbors.  

Most of the stores are still closed down and some may never open again.  Lemery the adjacent town is still ash covered and the two large mall and market are still closed down.  The road between our home and the small farm where we have our pigs ducks chickens and dogs is heavily warped with a least ten major cracks one where the road seems to have dropped about four feet.   Lots of earthen patches to permit transportation.   The city is full of detours now that the lockdown is over due to road damage or to ash cleanup.  Everywhere there are piled sacks of collected ash waiting to be disposed.  

Maria Jean tells me that the roads were blocked between our home and the bukid (our little farm) but that she knew all of the back dirt roads within the sugar cane fields that were unpoliced to keep Rodas family and the pigs fed.   

We took Mark and Bong to the bukid where I was surprised to see that Rodas husband now out of a construction job had added a makeshift room to the shack so that they as parents to the six remaining children could have some simple privacy.  He had also built an outdoor table area where we found our previous helper Rene laid out drunk.

Our subdivision is mostly dead but there is a crew from the management that is trying to sweep up the ash off the streets.  Our neighbors have not yet chosen to return.  Pastor Ferdy and family are still staying in Batangas organizing the relief efforts there.   We are looking at coordinating with him a team of Nazarenes who will be coming down in the middle of the week for relief services.  

I took the two men over to Farmville closed down for the three weeks of lost business but now in full mode of cleanup to see what the possibilities might be for housing the Nazarene volunteer team there for a night.   Thanks to the contributions that people have made here on FB I have some financial freedom to help in a variety of ways.   

Already the funds have paid for the over-baggage costs for the medicines ($200) for my flight change fee ($25) for the costs of driving to Taal paid to the DS for food items and needs for Roda and her family (including $20 specifically given to her---from a donor in Nebraska).  We will probably add the high power water hose ($160) and potentially an electric generator as electricity is inconsistent---both to be made available where needs are most apparent.  

We need to shore up the walls and roofing of the bukid shack for the protection of the Roda family (the roof had fallen in).   And I have promised to underwrite the expenses of the Nazarene team that will be coming down here.   

I will be distributing the protective masks as most people are using them now who have them.    Not only are people using them because of the ash blowing constantly in the air (our world looks like a windblown day in dry Arizona leaving people chocking and coughing) and visibility impaired but also now that the coronavirus has arrived in the Philippines (one case in Cebu) for the first time all airport personnel  and flight attendants are wearing masks. 

Despite all this lying in my own bed in the arms of my wife I could only pray a prayer of thankfulness knowing that just a week ago I did not know if I would ever have this moment in this place again.

This morning I will move the family temporarily to the campus of APNTS.   Im told that schools may be starting up again on February 10th.   The volcano is still at alert level 3.","661418383_10158134302058384","fletcher.tink"

L épidémie dun nouveau coronavirus à Wuhan en Chine a suscité la peur et lanxiété dans le monde malgré le faible taux de mortalité du virus.
Selon certains experts les réactions psychologiques des gens aux maladies infectieuses peuvent parfois être exagérées et faire plus de mal que de bien.
Pourtant des mesures préventives telles que le lavage des mains accru et ne pas toucher votre visage protègent contre les coronavirus et autres maladies.

Lépidémie dun nouveau coronavirus a suscité la peur et lanxiété dans le monde.

Le virus pneumonialike originaire de Wuhan en Chine a infecté plus de 9 700 personnes et en a tué 213.

Jusquà présent le virus ne semble pas aussi mortel que le SRAS  qui a tué 774 personnes de 2002 à 2003. Le SRAS avait un taux de mortalité de 96% alors quenviron 2% des personnes infectées par le nouveau coronavirus sont décédées. Mais le nombre de personnes infectées après un mois a déjà dépassé le total de huit mois de lépidémie de SRAS .

De nombreux patients atteints de coronavirus ont déjà récupéré complètement. Selon des responsables chinois la plupart de ceux qui sont décédés étaient des personnes âgées ou avaient dautres maladies qui ont compromis leur système immunitaire.

Les experts en santé publique affirment que pour la plupart la panique autour du coronavirus de Wuhan en dehors de la Chine est improductive et injustifiée. Le public doit prendre des précautions pour éviter de tomber malade mais les mesures préventives les plus efficaces sont les actions quotidiennes comme le lavage des mains accru et le fait de ne pas toucher votre visage.

Amira Roess professeur de santé mondiale et dépidémiologie à lUniversité George Mason a déclaré à Business Insider que la peur narrêterait pas la propagation du virus et pourrait avoir des impacts sociaux négatifs.

Il y a la propagation des maladies infectieuses puis il y a la propagation de la panique a déclaré Roess. «Ils ont des mécanismes très différents.»

Aux premiers stades dune épidémie de maladie infectieuse a ajouté Roess une grande partie de la panique est «la peur de linconnu».

La propagation de la maladie et la propagation de la peur
La recherche psychologique montre que les nouvelles menaces augmentent les niveaux danxiété plus que les menaces familières et que les gens ont tendance à sous-réagir aux menaces familières.

Par exemple il y a environ une chance sur sept que les maladies cardiaques soient la cause de la mort dun Américain tandis que la probabilité quil meure aux mains dun terroriste né à létranger est dune sur 45808. Mais selon une enquête réalisée en 2016 par lUniversité Chapman sur les craintes américaines  «lattaque terroriste contre la nation» et la «victime du terrorisme» figuraient toutes deux parmi les cinq principales inquiétudes des répondants.

Cette dynamique sest déroulée dans des pays hors dAfrique lors de lépidémie dEbola en Afrique de lOuest de 2014 à 2016 selon Paul Slovic psychologue et président de la Nonprofit Decision Research.

Ce qui sest passé était tout à fait cohérent avec ce que nous savons sur la perception des risques a écrit Slovic dans un article pour lAmerican Psychology Association . La minute où la menace Ebola a été communiquée elle a touché tous les boutons chauds: elle peut être fatale elle est invisible et difficile à protéger lexposition est involontaire et il nest pas clair que les autorités contrôlent la situation.

Les épidémies dEbola passées cependant avaient des taux de mortalité beaucoup plus élevés que le SRAS et le nouveau coronavirus: 25 à 90%. Dans le monde Ebola a tué plus de 33 000 personnes depuis 1976.

Conséquences racistes de la panique
Des ressortissants dorigine asiatique en France au Canada et aux États-Unis signalent des incidents de racisme en raison des craintes du public à légard du coronavirus de Wuhan.

Le Guardian a rapporté que près de 9 000 parents près de Toronto ont signé une pétition pour empêcher les élèves qui sétaient rendus en Chine au cours des 17 derniers jours daller à lécole.

«Cela doit cesser. Arrêtez de manger des animaux sauvages puis infectez tout le monde autour de vous » a écrit un signataire de la pétition. Arrêtez la propagation et mettez-vous en quarantaine ou retournez.

China faced deepening isolation over its coronavirus epidemic on Saturday as the death toll soared to 259 with the United States and Australia leading a growing list of nations to impose extraordinary Chinese travel bans.

With Britain Russia and Sweden among the countries confirming their first infections the virus has now spread to more than two dozen nations sending governments scurrying to limit their exposure.

The US toughened its stance on Friday by declaring a national emergency temporarily barring entry to foreigners who had been in China within the past two weeks.

“Foreign nationals other than immediate family of US citizens and permanent residents who have travelled in China within the last 14 days will be denied entry into the United States” Health Secretary Alex Azar said.

Australia said it was barring entry to non-citizens arriving from China while Australian citizens who had travelled there would be required to go into “self-isolation” for two weeks.

Vietnam suspended all flights from mainland China Hong Kong and Taiwan effective from Saturday. Similar expansive restrictions have been announced by countries including Italy Singapore and Chinas northern neighbour Mongolia.

The US Japan Britain Germany and other nations had already advised their citizens not to travel to China.

Unkind
Beijing insists it can contain the virus and called Washingtons advice against travel to China “unkind”. “Certainly it is not a gesture of goodwill” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.

The US emergency declaration also requires Americans returning from the ground zero Chinese province of Hubei to be placed in mandatory 14-day quarantine and health screening for American citizens coming from other parts of China.

The virus emerged in early December and has been traced to a market in Hubeis capital Wuhan that sold wild animals.

It spread globally on the wings of a Lunar New Year holiday rush that sees hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel domestically and overseas.

In a bid to stop the contagion the government has extended the holiday through this weekend and urged people to avoid public gatherings.

Many provinces and cities have called on companies to remain closed for another week after the holiday ends on Monday.

The economic fallout continued on Saturday as Apple announced that its China stores would be closed until February 9 “out of an abundance of caution and based on the latest advice from leading health experts”.

Mea culpa
With public anger mounting in China Wuhans top official admitted late Friday that authorities there had acted too slowly expressing “remorse and self-reproach”.

“If strict control measures had been taken earlier the result would have been better than now” Ma Guoqiang the Communist Party chief for Wuhan told state media.

Wuhan officials have been criticised online for withholding information about the outbreak until late December despite knowing of it weeks earlier.

China finally lurched into action last week effectively quarantining whole cities in Hubei and tens of millions of people.

Unprecedented safeguards imposed nationwide include postponing the return to school cutting bus and train routes and tightening health screening on travellers nationwide.

But the toll keeps mounting at an ever-increasing pace with health authorities on Saturday saying 46 more people had died in the preceding 24 hours all but one in Hubei.

Another 2102 new infections were also confirmed bringing the total to nearly 12000 — far higher than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak of 2002-03.

SARS which is caused by a pathogen similar to the new coronavirus and also originated in China killed 774 people worldwide — most of them in mainland China and Hong Kong.

The World Health Organisation declared the outbreak a global emergency on Thursday but did not advise international trade or tra

San Francisco Department of Public Health preparation for novel coronavirus response -- The San Francisco Department of Public Health (DPH) is actively preparing to respond to the novel (new) coronavirus originating in Wuhan China.

To date San Francisco has no confirmed cases of the new illness. The national Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began screening travelers at SFO on January 18 who were arriving from Wuhan. 

The CDC is the lead agency for this event and we are working closely with them and the California Department of Public Health on this rapidly evolving situation in order to stay up to date about new developments. The CDC has been screening arriving passengers at five United States airports and has confirmed five cases in this country including two in California (Los Angeles County and Orange County).

San Francisco’s DPH activated its Departmental Operations Center (DOC) on January 21 which is a formal mechanism to organize emergency preparedness and response bringing together clinical and operations experts throughout the department. The DOC meets daily to report progress and identify and solve issues that arise. 

Our first preparedness priorities have been accomplished:
• Issue health advisories to San Francisco providers about the symptoms of the virus and what steps to take if they have a patient who may have the illness.  
• Communicate with all city hospitals and identify isolation rooms in case of incoming patients with the new virus.  
• Collaborate with the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management (DEM) and other City Departments on citywide preparation and information sharing. 
• Establish transport protocols with the Emergency Medical Services to ensure that ambulances are prepared for incoming patients and are able to take infection control precautions for safe transport.
• Arrange for direct delivery of specimens from the DPH lab to the CDC lab for testing any suspect cases. 
• Communicate with SFO and the San Mateo County Health Department (where SFO is located) to establish plans for transporting patients to San Francisco if needed. 
• Inform the community about the facts of novel coronavirus and how to stay healthy and safe. We created fact sheets in English and Chinese and disseminated to the public the Chinese media and providers and community organizations in the Chinese community. 

At this time residents of the Bay Area are at low risk of becoming infected with this novel (new) coronavirus unless they have recently traveled to Wuhan or have come in close contact with someone who was ill who recently traveled in that area.

The seven Bay Area Departments of Public Health (San Francisco Alameda Marin Contra Costa San Mateo Santa Cruz and Santa Clara counties and the City of Berkeley) are tightly coordinated monitoring the issue learning about the disease from the CDC and will be tracking any cases that are confirmed in the Bay Area to ensure appropriate precautions across the region. 

San Franciscans can still protect their health by taking preventive measures such as consistent hand washing covering coughs and sneezes and staying home if sick. It’s not too late to get a flu shot to help prevent illness and symptoms similar to the novel (new) coronavirus. 

DPH is continuing to monitor the situation and as conditions change we are prepared to implement additional measures and work with DEM to respond and protect the health of the city and all residents.","21800505255_10157698749190256","NormanYeeSF"

As part of this administration’s preventive measures against the 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and its adherence to the mandate of ensuring public health and safety such undertaking was deemed necessary.

We continue to seek everyone’s cooperation towards heeding the precautionary measures and safety advisories being promulgated.

Saul an international expert on vitamin therapy says “The coronavirus can be dramatically slowed or stopped completely with the immediate widespread use of high doses of vitamin C. Bowel tolerance levels of C taken in divided doses throughout the day is a clinically proven antiviral without equal.”

Saul adds “Dr. Robert F. Cathcart who had extensive experience treating viral diseases remarked ’I have not seen any flu yet that was not cured or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin.”

Professor Victor Marcial-Vega of the Caribe School of Medicine responds “Given the relatively high rate of success of intravenous vitamin C in viral diseases and my observation of clinical improvement within 2 to 3 hours of treatment I strongly believe it would be my first recommendation in the management of the coronavirus.”

He adds “I have also used intravenous vitamin C to treat patients with influenza dengue fever and chikungunya for 24 years.”

Dr. Jeffery Allyn Ruterbusch Associate Professor at Central Michigan University says “I believe all of us agree on the greatly increased benefits of vitamin C when people are placed under any stressful condition.”

Dr. Damien Downing former editor of the Journal of Nutritional and Environmental Medicine writes: “Swine flu bird flu and SARS all developed in selenium-deficient China. When patients were given selenium viral mutation rates dropped and immunity improved.”

Several other authorities agreed that high doses of vitamin C along with 3000 IU of vitamin D and 20 milligrams of zinc was a good combination to help fight viral diseases. And Drs. Carolyn Dean and Thomas Levy both world authorities on magnesium stressed that the mineral is involved in 1000 metabolic reactions and that maintaining adequate levels improves immunity. Another over-riding opinion was that few people know that high doses of C increase immunity and destroy viral diseases.

This information is not new. During the great polio epidemic of 1949-50 Dr. Frederick R. Klenner a family physician in North Carolina treated 60 polio patients with high doses of intravenous vitamin C. None developed paralysis. This discovery should have made headlines around the world but Dr. Klenner’s news fell on deaf ears.

Later Klenner proved that high doses of C could also be effective as treatments for meningitis pneumonia measles hepatitis and other viral and bacterial diseases. Even the bite of a rattlesnake. Again only scorn from the medical profession.

?? What does this mean to North Americans? Patients with a diagnosis of coronavirus should be given intravenous vitamin C and it will save lives. The problem is that most doctors still refuse to believe IVC is effective.

He trained in general surgery at the Strong Memorial Hospital University of Rochester Montreal General Hospital McGill University and in gynecology at Harvard. He has also been a general practitioner ship’s surgeon and hotel doctor.

¿Por qué China? ¿De dónde sale este mortal y terrible coronavirus que se propaga en el mundo? ¿Son creíbles las cifras oficiales? ¿Tiene relación al consumo del murciélago? ¿Son señales del FIN?

Estas son algunas preguntas que muchos han enviado a nuestro buzón de mensajes. La Biblia es contundente al advertir que en los últimos días vendrán tiempos terribles de mucho sufrimiento sobre la raza humana ¿Y por qué? dejemos que la misma Biblia responda:

Génesis 6: 3 Y dijo Jehová: No contenderá mi espíritu con el hombre para siempre porque ciertamente él es carne mas serán sus días ciento veinte años. 5 Y vio Jehová que la maldad de los hombres era mucha en la tierra y que todo designio de los pensamientos del corazón de ellos era de continuo solamente el mal. 

La humanidad neciamente decide apartarse del cuidado divino y el resultado es mortal.

EL LABORATORIO DEL DIABLO

Elena de White lo vio claramente y no dudó en dejarlo escrito: Satanás obra asimismo por medio de los elementos para cosechar muchedumbres de almas aún no preparadas. Tiene estudiados los secretos de los laboratorios de la naturaleza y emplea todo su poder para dirigir los elementos en cuanto Dios se lo permita. Cuando se le dejó que afligiera a Job ¡cuán prestamente fueron destruidos rebaños ganado sirvientes casas e hijos en una serie de desgracias obra de un momento! Es Dios quien protege a sus criaturas y las guarda del poder del destructor. Pero el mundo cristiano ha manifestado su menosprecio de la ley de Jehová y el Señor hará exactamente lo que declaró que haría: alejará sus bendiciones de la tierra y retirará su cuidado protector de sobre los que se rebelan contra su ley y que enseñan y obligan a los demás a hacer lo mismo. Satanás ejerce dominio sobre todos aquellos a quienes Dios no guarda en forma especial. Favorecerá y hará prosperar a algunos para obtener sus fines y atraerá desgracias sobre otros al mismo tiempo que hará creer a los hombres que es Dios quien los aflige. CS 575.4

CORONAVIRUS: Al par que se hace pasar ante los hijos de los hombres como un gran médico que puede curar todas sus enfermedades Satanás producirá enfermedades y desastres al punto que ciudades populosas sean reducidas a ruinas y desolación. Ahora mismo está obrando. Ejerce su poder en todos los lugares y bajo mil formas...

TERREMOTOS: En las desgracias y calamidades de mar y tierra en las grandes conflagraciones en los tremendos huracanes y en las terribles tempestades de granizo en las inundaciones en los ciclones en las mareas extraordinarias y en los terremotos. Destruye las mieses casi maduras y a ello siguen la hambruna y la angustia... 

CORONAVIRUS: Propaga por el aire emanaciones mefíticas Que no puede ser respirado por causar daño al organismo y miles de seres perecen en la pestilencia. Estas plagas irán menudeando repitiéndose más y más y se harán más y más desastrosas. La destrucción caerá sobre hombres y animales. “La tierra se pone de luto y se marchita” “desfallece la gente encumbrada de la tierra. La tierra también es profanada bajo sus habitantes porque traspasaron la ley cambiaron el estatuto y quebrantaron el pacto eterno”. Isaías 24:4 5 (VM). CS 576.1

DETRÁS DEL TELÓN

Satanás adversario y enemigo de Dios ¿Y qué buscas con tanto desastre? Y luego el gran engañador persuadirá a los hombres de que son los que sirven a Dios los que causan esos males. CS 576.2

La política de Satanás en este conflicto final con el pueblo de Dios es la misma que la seguida por él al principio de la gran controversia en el cielo. Hacía como si procurase la estabilidad del gobierno divino mientras que por lo bajo hacía cuanto podía por derribarlo y acusaba a los ángeles fieles de esa misma obra que estaba así tratando de realizar. CS 577.2

SU PLAN NO CAMBIA

Los que honran el sábado de la Biblia serán denunciados como enemigos de la ley y del orden como quebrantadores de las restricciones morales de la sociedad y por lo tanto causantes de anarquía y corrupción que atraen sobre la tierra los altos juicios de Dios. CS 578.1

To sum up — we have expanded our travel advisory to defer all non-essential travel to the rest of China. We will enhance screening efforts at our air checkpoints with additional attention to flights from China. We have also advised precautionary measures for students as well as adult workers in the education healthcare and eldercare sectors who are returning from China.

While this will lead to some inconvenience we seek your support and understanding for these additional measures to keep us safe. Singapore is also working closely with the WHO and all countries to mitigate the global spread of this virus.

We are monitoring the Wuhan coronavirus situation very closely and will adapt our responses accordingly. We will spare no effort to keep Singaporeans safe. 

In the meantime please stay vigilant calm and informed. You can get the latest updates at the Ministry of Health Singapore website: https:www.moh.gov.sg2019-ncov-wuhan

The CDC has confirmed the first cases of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the U.S. in Arizona California Illinois and Washington.

The CDC is closely monitoring the situation and is working with the World Health Organization. It is important to know that based on current information the immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV to the general American public is deemed to be low at this time. 

All individuals visiting Schiffert Health Center are screened prior to their appointment for any recent international travel. Those who have traveled from China to the U.S. will be asked questions about their health and travel history. Schiffert advises anyone to seek medical care and alert a healthcare provider that has traveled to Wuhan City within the past 14 days and is experiencing a fever with or without respiratory symptoms.

The Virginia Tech community should reach out to Schiffert Health Center with questions or concerns.

A prayer from a Wuhan church has reached our city and I would like to share this with you.  To hear from those in the “city surrounded by the shadow of death” as they called it.  There are 11 million people in Wuhan it is a huge city.  There are over 50 million Chinese in the cities that are closed (as of Jan 27).  Buses are shut down.  Subways are shut down.  Most need to walk to get food and prices have increased as the food is getting scarce.  Please please skip a meal and pray to our Precious Lord for them. 
 
Here’s the translated prayer a request for the Chinese churches to pray for them:
 
 
All Gods people please ask the Chinese church to pray urgently!
 
God full of compassion and mercy we prostrate before you and we confess that we sinned and are short of Gods glory.  Wuhan and the surrounding cities have now been closed and the spread of the virus has exceeded our capacity. The city is surrounded by the shadow of death. 
 
We the covenant people who have received the great grace cry out to You Lord asking You to cleanse and forgive our self-confidence and ignorance. Our neglect has created a global disaster and we are humble before you.  Please make our hearts more compassionate and humble.  We ask You Lord to save us from this great calamity we ask You Lord to forgive our sins and transgressions and save us from greater disaster because we have not one person that can stand in front of you.
 
 
On January 23 the country implemented a city closure in Wuhan and surrounding cities
 
We pray that the Spirit of God will work in our hearts give us strength and perseverance return our hearts to Christ let us remember God ’s promises and love each other more faithfully and give us humility. We only praise Christ and He crucified us.  The cross we believe that the blood of Christ alone can save us from chaos restlessness and the new coronavirus.
 
We pray that Heavenly Father will arouse people around the world to pray and fast. Please look after the patients with severe fever and isolation and all those who care for them and give them good strength and great comfort.
 
 
Pray for the wisdom of the virus researchers and their solutions.
 
Pray that the righteousness of the government will be decisive and transparent and that a strong sense of responsibility be given to government officials.  Pray that the Lord will give us love endure long-term patience do not attack the government with bad words do not complain do not lose heart and do not fear.
 
 
Wuhan under the closed city is like an empty city.
 
Ask God to give people not to be selfish not to hide but to have a strong sense of social responsibility to protect more elderly and children
 
Pray for God to pay special attention to protecting many villagers in the countryside. A large number of floating population are in the biggest hidden danger.
 
Pray that the brethren and sisters and fellow citizens in Wuhan should be extra vigilant increase awareness of prevention and knowledge of virus transmission and no longer take it lightly to say nothing dont care
 
May God the Almighty Lord give the weather warmth so that the virus has no living environment and will not continue to spread to other cities rural areas and countries.
 
 
Hospital cant help so many patients:
 
Ask God to remember the health care workers in particular to protect them so that the medical orders used will be effective and the patients will be fully healed
 
Pray for the Lords mercy let us miss that our body is only dust how weak and vulnerable we are and we admit how unwilling our heart is to be comforted
 
May the Lord grant us repentance and the forgiveness of sins and give us a more diligent preaching a commitment to the gospel a righteous upright and clean life a Christian culture and a more dedicated faithfulness. This life is peaceful and full of peace.  Hope for the end.
 
 
The cross is Gods mighty salvation
 
Merciful God God who is not easy to be angry and has abundant love please remove anger soon remember the cry of your people and have mercy on our prayer in this city!
 
These are the prayers of the churches that the Lord loves all in the holy name of our Redeemer Jesus Christ. 
 
Amen!

The United States are restricting travelers from China while forcing a quarantine and monitored self-isolation protocol.

On the other side the Canadian government is still doing nothing. The only precaution implemented is the airport screening which doesnt even take care of people with symptoms and never worked in previous 4 confirmed cases.
https:www.cbc.canewscanadatorontoairport-screening-coronavirus-canada-toronto-1.5446959

I have to point out that all 4 confirmed cases didnt cause any spread of the virus was because the people returned from China put themselves in self-isolation or didnt contact other people. Imagine if they went out shopping gathering partying while carrying the virus what could happen?

Today the health minister said Canada will not follow US to declare emergency (https:www.cbc.canewspoliticschampagne-coronavirus-airlift-china-1.5447130) while neglected the facts that the virus can spread human-to-human without symptoms and while in incubation. This is government inaction.

I dont know what gave the government that much confident. For me until today Canada only had 4 cases was purely because of luck - comparing with what the government did.

Also arrested were two Chinese “Students” working as research assistants one of whom was actually a lieutenant in the Chinese Army the other captured at Logan Airport as he tried to catch a flight to China - smuggling 21 vials of “Sensitive Biological Samples” according to the FBI.

*My statement on the First Confirmed Case of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the Philippines 

I urge the government to immediately impose a travel ban on all individuals traveling from China and all travelers who have passed through China in the past two weeks. 

My proposal is a temporary travel ban of at least 30 days in light of the first confirmed case of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the country. 

Our travel ban must firmly include both air and sea travel to prevent a local outbreak. This includes a temporary ban on all cruise ships from docking at any of our ports. 

I also urge the Bureau of Quarantine to implement mandatory quarantine remain vigilant and to study the safety measures of our neighboring countries with confirmed cases of nCoV. 

This temporary travel ban will give time for our health authorities to set in place all safeguards necessary in case there is more confirmation of the 2019-nCoV presence in the country from those under present surveillance.  

I also call on our public health units especially our barangay health centers to engage in active community surveillance. 

Finally I am asking our government to extend full assistance to our Overseas Filipino Workers in China or in any country with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus who seek repatriation in relation to possible exposure.

Ils sont français mais aussi belges néerlandais ou suédois : un deuxième avion de 250 rapatriés de Wuhan – épicentre de l’épidémie du nouveau coronavirus en Chine – affrété par le gouvernement français a atterri dimanche 2 février dans l’après-midi sur la base militaire d’Istres près de Marseille.

Dimanche dans la soirée la ministre de la Santé Agnès Buzyn a annoncé qu’« une vingtaine de personnes qui présentaient des symptômes sont restées sur le tarmac » à Istres (Bouches-du-Rhône) « sous la surveillance des médecins militaires le temps d’avoir un test ». Il s’agit à la fois de ressortissants « français et non-européens ».

Soixante-cinq Français sont présents parmi les 250 passagers issus de 30 nationalités qui ont atterri vers 14 h 30. « Les pays concernés par ce rapatriement pour une bonne partie d’entre eux vont nous permettre d’assurer un bord à bord permettant le retour de ces personnes dans les pays d’origine » a déclaré le ministre des affaires étrangères Jean-Yves Le Drian sans fournir plus de précisions techniques sur les lieux où se feraient ces transferts.

Le chef de la diplomatie a aussi salué une coopération « remarquable » avec les autorités chinoises. « Tous les Français qui ont demandé à être rapatriés le sont » a-t-il indiqué précisant que le rapatriement du personnel diplomatique français n’était pas à l’ordre du jour. A Paris une grande réunion interministérielle doit avoir lieu dimanche soir autour du premier ministre au sujet du coronavirus.

En quarantaine dans une école de pompiers
Une partie des passagers du vol attendu dimanche des ressortissants français notamment seront pris en charge dans le centre de vacances de Carry-le-Rouet une station balnéaire proche de Marseille où sont déjà en quarantaine près de 180 personnes arrivées de Wuhan vendredi a précisé la préfecture des Bouches-du-Rhône.

Jointe par l’Agence France-Presse (AFP) la Croix-Rouge qui gère la logistique et l’animation de ce site depuis vendredi a indiqué qu’il y restait « une cinquantaine de places d’hébergement ». D’autres rapatriés seront placés en quarantaine à Aix-en-Provence dans une école d’officiers de sapeurs-pompiers l’Ensosp qui peut accueillir plus de 500 personnes.

« Nous avons eu confirmation vendredi par la préfecture et l’Ensosp que nous allions accueillir ces personnes » a indiqué à l’AFP une porte-parole de la mairie. Dès vendredi la maire Maryse Joissains-Masini (LR) déplorait dans un communiqué avoir « appris par la presse » le choix de sa commune pour l’accueil des rapatriés.

Devant l’entrée fermée de ce site entièrement grillagé dimanche matin des gendarmes et des CRS patrouillaient. Le centre de formation situé en zone rurale est loin des habitations et à une dizaine de kilomètres du centre-ville d’Aix-en-Provence.

Une partie des rapatriés de dimanche ne débarquera toutefois pas en France mais en Belgique selon une source diplomatique à Bruxelles selon laquelle l’appareil emportera ensuite vers l’aéroport militaire de Melsbroek des ressortissants belges et d’autres nationalités. D’après l’agence Belga 9 Belges 11 Danois 23 Néerlandais 5 Tchèques et 2 Slovaques seront notamment débarqués à Melsbroek.

Dear Parents and Guardians

I am writing about the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus. Schools have received many enquiries from parents who are understandably concerned about their childrens health and I felt it was important to communicate directly with our families and staff.

The Richmond School District has been working closely with provincial and local health authorities to ensure that accurate information is available and that appropriate steps are being taken by the district. Public health officials continue to make it clear that the risk of this virus within B.C. remains low and all necessary precautions are being taken to prevent the spread of infection.

We know that there are significant amounts of information about novel coronavirus available online particularly through social media. Unfortunately much of that information is not accurate and is causing unnecessary fear in our community. It is critical that as we make decisions we do so with information that is current accurate and based on medical science. Please refer to the most recent updates from Vancouver Coastal Health buff.ly2Fuacgo and the BC Centre for Disease Control buff.ly37FwnLX.

Health authorities have also made it clear that the best defense against any cold and flu virus is proper respiratory hygiene. This includes proper hand-washing with soap and water and covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. The school district is committed to ensuring that soap dispensers in school washrooms are kept well-supplied and that surfaces that students touch frequently are cleaned on a regular basis. Hand sanitizer dispensers have been ordered for the main entrance to every school in our district as an additional precautionary measure. Please understand that these are all preventative measures designed to keep students and staff healthy and are in no way indications that parents should be concerned about sending their children to school.

We do ask that if your child is displaying any signs of a cold or flu such as coughing and sneezing that you keep your child at home. Some parents have asked that schools require students who have recently arrived from China to stay at home for a minimum of two weeks. It is important to note that schools do not have the authority to make public health decisions such as requiring students to remain at home for health reasons. If any steps were to be taken in relation to a public health concern it would be at the direction of the Ministry of Health and Vancouver Coastal Health.

The Richmond School District prides itself on its inclusive respectful and welcoming approach. During this difficult time it is important to remind ourselves that now more than ever we need to remain united as a community doing whatever we can to care for not only ourselves but for each other.

Moving forward we will remain in contact with the Ministry of Health Vancouver Coastal Health and the Ministry of Education and will continue to provide updates to our community as they become available.

Sincerely

Scott Robinson
Superintendent of Schools","145764302123530_2963297153703550","RichmondSD38"

China has taken steps to limit short-selling activities as the countrys financial markets prepare to reopen on Monday amid an outbreak of a new coronavirus three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

The sources said China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) had issued a verbal directive to brokerages including Citic Securities Co. and China International Capital Corp. to bar their clients from selling borrowed stocks on 3 February.

It was not clear if the suspension ??? which was first reported on Sunday by Chinese media outlet 21st Century Business Herald ??? would be extended beyond Monday one of the sources said.

Hong Kong stocks erased morning session gains and ended lower on Friday dragged down by healthcare and energy. However bargain-hunting emerged in consumer stocks which were battered by a recent selloff amid fears of the coronavirus outbreak in China.

The Hang Seng Index closed down 0.5 per cent at 26312.63 points the lowest since 5 December ending the three-session trading week 5.9 per cent lower. The China Enterprises Index dropped 0.8 per cent to 10240.51 points.

In Japan the benchmark recorded its worst weekly slide in six months on fears of the rapidly-spreading coronavirus in China.

The Nikkei share average ended 1.0 per cent higher at 23205.18 but lost 2.6 per cent in the week. Januarys fall of 1.9 per cent was its first monthly loss since August last year.

Europe

European shares gave up earlier gains to end firmly in negative territory on Friday after the United Kingdom and Italy confirmed their first coronavirus cases and with a set of disappointing euro zone indicators also weighing on sentiment.

Britains blue chip index closed down 1.3 per cent while Milans main benchmark bled 2.3 per cent as the countrys cabinet declared a state of emergency over the virus. Britain and Italy have two cases each.

The pan-European STOXX 600 ended 1.1 per cent lower taking losses this week to 3 per cent for its worst week in almost six months. On the month it lost 1.2 per cent - its worst January since 2016.

The World Health Organization declared the epidemic a global emergency on Thursday as the death toll passed 200 and the number of cases of infection rose to nearly 10000.

While the illness has been centred on China governments around the world are scrambling to stop its spread and travel curbs and supply chain disruptions have prompted economists to reassess the potential economic fallout from the outbreak.

Miners were the biggest losers down 1.6 per cent on worries that China and its gigantic market for raw materials will come to a standstill if the epidemic worsens.

Travel and leisure stocks also extended losses as more airlines suspended flights to China.

Concerns about the euro zone economy also pushed stocks downwards.

Economic growth in the bloc was less than expected in the last quarter of 2019 mainly due to surprise GDP contractions in France and Italy while core inflation slowed in January in a worrying sign for the European Central Bank.

The United Kingdoms official exit from the European Union later on Friday had no immediate impact on stocks but it fuels uncertainty going forward. The FTSE 100 is roughly back to where it was before Prime Minister Boris Johnsons landslide election win on 12 December during which he promised to get Brexit done.

In October of 2019 an event was hosted at John Hopkins Medical Center called Event 201 where a mock scenario was played out of a coronavirus becoming a pandemic leading to 65 million deaths within 18 months. 

The event was funded by the World Health Organization and The Gates Foundation. 

15 leaders from governmentbusiness and public health were chosen to have a round table discussion in front of a live audience about this false pandemic scenario treating it as if were a real life scenario - even having live news updates about the virus from a made up news source GNN (Global News Network).  

http:www.centerforhealthsecurity.orgevent201about

Less than 2 months later the current coronavirus outbreak from China began coincidentally of course. 

In November 2019 an episode of Explained featured Bill Gates where he explained a viral pandemic is bound to occur at any time. He even mentioned the likelihood of such a pandemic originating in the wet markets in China. 

https:www.ccn.combill-gates-predicted-coronavirus-like-outbreak-in-2019-netflix-documentary

Also in November 2019 the Pirbright Institute a biochemistry research institution in England was awarded 5.5 million dollars from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for a Livestock Antibody Hub. 

https:thepoultrysite.comnews201911pirbrights-livestock-antibody-hub-receives-5-5-million-award-from-bill-melinda-gates-foundation

The Pirbright Institute filed a patent for coronavirus in 2015 and the application was granted in November 2019. Of course this is completely unrelated to the current coronavirus of China according to Snopes and mainstream media - and to suggest such is a ridiculous conspiracy theory. 

https:patents.google.compatentEP3172319B1en

In a 2010 Ted Talk Bill Gates stated:

 First we’ve got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That’s headed up to about nine billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines health care reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent but there we see an increase of about 1.3. 

https:youtu.be6WQtRI7A064 

Now as much as it might sound like hes stating vaccines and healthcare can be used to reduce population or population growth Snopes and other fact checkers along with the MSM will assure you thats not the case and thats just another conspiracy theory.

Its well known Gates father Bill Gates Sr. sat on the board of Planned Parenthood and Gates admits growing up in that environment made a huge impact on him and his quest & desire for population control. Its an interest he shares with several other wealthy billionaires such as Warren Buffett David Rockefeller George Soros & Ted Turner to name a few. 

http:www.physiciansforlife.orgbill-gates-father-head-of-planned-parenthood-inspired-his-abortion-population-control-views

However Im sure all of this is merely coincidental. We all know Gates is such a wonderful philanthropist - as were constantly reminded. 

But these seem like an awful lot of uncanny coincidences and the more I learn the more Im concerned this latest outbreak could lead to a pandemic as described during Event 201. As of today the death toll has reached over 300.  

Speaking of coincidences and Event 201 the MSM reported that 201 passengers flew home to California from affected areas in China this past Wednesday but that number was later lowered to 195 and said the other 6 originally counted were the planes crew. ?

But these seem like an awful lot of uncanny coincidences and the more I learn the more Im concerned this latest outbreak could lead to a pandemic as described during Event 201. As of today the death toll has reached over 300.  

Speaking of coincidences and Event 201 the MSM reported that 201 passengers flew home to California from affected areas in China this past Wednesday but that number was later lowered to 195 and said the other 6 originally counted were the planes crew. ?

This week several members of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service (OMNS) were asked “How would you treat the coronavirus?” Here are opinions of experts who study the potential of nutrients to fight disease.

Dr. Andrew W. Saul an international expert on vitamin therapy says “The coronavirus can be dramatically slowed or stopped completely with the immediate widespread use of high doses of vitamin C. Bowel tolerance levels of C taken in divided doses throughout the day is a clinically proven antiviral without equal.”

Saul adds “Dr. Robert F. Cathcart who had extensive experience treating viral diseases remarked ’I have not seen any flu yet that was not cured or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin.”

Professor Victor Marcial-Vega of the Caribe School of Medicine responds “Given the relatively high rate of success of intravenous vitamin C in viral diseases and my observation of clinical improvement within 2 to 3 hours of treatment I strongly believe it would be my first recommendation in the management of the coronavirus.”

He adds “I have also used intravenous vitamin C to treat patients with influenza dengue fever and chikungunya for 24 years.”

Dr. Jeffery Allyn Ruterbusch Associate Professor at Central Michigan University says “I believe all of us agree on the greatly increased benefits of vitamin C when people are placed under any stressful condition.”

Dr. Damien Downing former editor of the Journal of Nutritional and Environmental Medicine writes: “Swine flu bird flu and SARS all developed in selenium-deficient China. When patients were given selenium viral mutation rates dropped and immunity improved.”

Several other authorities agreed that high doses of vitamin C along with 3000 IU of vitamin D and 20 milligrams of zinc was a good combination to help fight viral diseases. And Drs. Carolyn Dean and Thomas Levy both world authorities on magnesium stressed that the mineral is involved in 1000 metabolic reactions and that maintaining adequate levels improves immunity. Another over-riding opinion was that few people know that high doses of C increase immunity and destroy viral diseases.

This information is not new. During the great polio epidemic of 1949-50 Dr. Frederick R. Klenner a family physician in North Carolina treated 60 polio patients with high doses of intravenous vitamin C. None developed paralysis. This discovery should have made headlines around the world but Dr. Klenner’s news fell on deaf ears.

Later Klenner proved that high doses of C could also be effective as treatments for meningitis pneumonia measles hepatitis and other viral and bacterial diseases. Even the bite of a rattlesnake. Again only scorn from the medical profession.

What does this mean to North Americans? Patients with a diagnosis of coronavirus should be given intravenous vitamin C and it will save lives. The problem is that most doctors still refuse to believe IVC is effective.

I’m not your doctor. But my family and friends know to visit a health food store and stock up on Medi C Plus a powdered form of vitamin C that I developed which allows for high doses to be easily consumed and which contains needed lysine and magnesium. Vitamin C pills will do but you must swallow many of them. Start taking 2000 mg twice a day to build up immunity. If flu symptoms develop take 2000 mg every hour up to bowel tolerance and see a doctor. Large doses of C cause loose stools. But better to sit on a toilet than under a gravestone.

“It was a really big bag and it was full” said the woman at the Prince Street Shoppers Drug MartCanada Post outlet who didn’t want to disclose her name.

On Tuesday a day after the unusual occurrence the drug store was all out of surgical masks the woman said.

Max Chen a native of China and student at Cape Breton University had scoured the city for surgical masks on Monday but had no luck. The university’s Chinese community is on edge over the global Wuhan coronavirus outbreak he said. The virus has killed more than 200 people and infected at least 9700 worldwide.

The mask shipments are needed in China where in some areas there’s a shortage. But for Chen he was looking to protect himself from the possibility that a member of the university’s Chinese community is infected with the virus. He’s said he’s among many Chinese CBU students worried about the threat on campus.

A woman from Wuhan where the virus originated arrived in Sydney on Christmas Day. Though there have been no confirmed cases of the virus he remains unconvinced that she hasn’t been infected.

Chen’s fear is ultimately rooted in his distrust of the Chinese government. He and many CBU Chinese students believe the government is lying about the extent of the outbreak. Chen whos among roughly 3500 Chinese university students in Nova Scotia fears that no one knows just how virulent the virus is. He believes the university and the province’s public health officials are unprepared to deal with an outbreak at the university.

We believe that the Chinese government is not telling other countries the truth about this virus said Chen. We’re not getting good reliable information from anyone. Public health and the university is saying we’re at very low risk but I don’t believe it.”

Yanjun Dong a fellow Chinese CBU student agrees.

“A lot of us are panicking because we know there are a lot of people from Wuhan City that go to the university and many of them went home for Christmas break and came back” said Dong. “People can be infected and not show any symptoms but pass it on to others.”

Cape Breton University spokeswoman Lenore Parsley said in an email that the administration is aware of these concerns and they’re being addressed. She said students faculty and staff have been provided “current and accurate information as relayed to us by the Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness and the chief medical officer of health Dr. Robert Strang.”

She said the university’s health centre has been contending  with many concerns from students about the virus and “that we are communicating the importance of healthy flu prevention habits and have met with our cleaning service provider to ensure rigorous cleaning in classrooms common spaces and other high traffic areas.”

Ajantha Jayabarathan a Halifax family physician said the students have grounds to be concerned. Jayabarathan has been keeping up on the emerging evidence on the virus and the latest public health data. She also believes the number of infections in China is much higher than the official numbers show given the country’s critical shortage of testing kits and its enormous population. Wuhan alone has a population of 10 million.

But she said the country has responded well to the crisis in other ways saying it has offered the genome of the virus immediately to the world and a vaccine is already on the way. She estimated it would take about a year before a vaccine would be available.

The single thing we have to do right now is to stop the spread of the virus because what we know about viruses is the more they spread and the more host bodies they infect there’s a greater and greater opportunity for them to develop defences against the host immune system.

But she said the provinces Department of Health has been slow in providing critical information about the evolving virus to residents and front-line health-care workers. The physician questions whether a system already strained by a health-care crisis is prepared for an outbreak at a university or anywhere else.

On Thursday the province launched a website containing information on the virus. By comparison Newfoundland launched a similar site almost a month earlier on Dec. 31. New Brunswick did the same almost a week before Nova Scotia.

Jayabarathan believes the province should introduce an 811 coronavirus hotline run by public health.

If there is a threat then very quickly these people can be tested by a doctor or paramedics and potentially be quarantined. They should not go to a walk-in clinic or overcrowded emergency room.

The province advises potentially infected people to seek care at their local emergency room. But that option presents problems said the physician. Beyond being a potential breeding ground for the virus she said sev

Published February 1 2020 1:29 PM
By Merlina Hernando-Malipot 

Registration desks in public schools officially opened on Saturday as the Department of Education (DepEd) pushed through with the scheduled Early Registration for School Year (SY) 2020-2021.

The Early Registration is an annual activity led by DepEd to ensure that all new entrants for Kindergarten Grades 1 7 and 11 learners in public and private elementary and secondary schools nationwide are listed months before the opening of the new school year.

DepEd’s Early Registration desks are open starting February 1 Saturday to March 6 Friday 2020. The Early Registration was originally scheduled from January 25 (Saturday) to February 28 (Friday) 2020 but it was moved to the current dates since January 25 was declared Chinese New Year.

The Early Registration is compulsory for public schools while optional for private schools.

Take Precautionary Measures

As DepEd pushes through with the scheduled Early Registration it reminded schools to take precautionary measures amid the threat of the novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (nCoV-ARD) spreading in the country.

Education Secretary Leonor Briones in a text message to Manila Bulletin said that the Early Registration pushed through despite the first confirmed case of the 2019-nCoV in the country as announced by the Department of Health. “I believe so” she said when asked if the schools will push through with the scheduled activity. “Not all regions are affected by nCoV” she added.

Earlier Undersecretary for Planning and Field Operations Jesus Mateo also confirmed to the Manila Bulletin the Manila Bulletin that the scheduled Early Registration will push through as planned. However he reminded that “we have to take precautionary measures.”

In a memorandum issued by DepEd Undersecretary for Administration Alain Del Pascua dated on January 24 2020 the agency alerted all regional directors schools division superintendents principals or school heads both teaching and non-teaching personnel learners and all others concerned to “take precautionary measures against the possible spread of the virus.”

In particular Pascua strictly advised everyone to take precautionary measures such as making hand washing a habit to always cover one’s mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing to avoid close contact with people who show signs of respiratory illness to drink plenty of water and ensure foods are cooked properly and to consult a health facility if “symptoms of cough and colds persist.”

DepEd in its earlier statement on nCoV-ARD expressed readiness to “contribute to the overall Philippine government efforts for the management of this public health situation” following the first confirmed case of the deadly virus in the country.

Members of DepEd ExeCom also recommended the creation of a Task Force on nCoV-ARD which aims to address the concerns and challenges that schools may face with the confirmation of the first nCoV-ARD case in the Philippines.

Month-long Registration

DepEd’s Early Registration is being conducted in public schools months before the opening of the new school year to help ensure that the agency will be able to accommodate incoming learners.

The surge of last minute enrollees has been a constant challenge to DepEd – with public school heads and teachers scrambling to accommodate learners who register on the first day of classes. Congested classrooms – especially in highly-urbanized areas where construction of new school buildings is a challenge due to lack of buildable space – is among the common problems faced by DepEd every school opening.

To help public schools anticipate the number of enrollees for the coming school year the Early Registration was instituted in the DepEd Order (DO) No. 3 s. 2018 otherwise known as the “Basic Education Enrolment Policy.”

Aside from incoming kinder and grades 1 7 and 11 students the Early Regisration also “seeks to locate identify and register” out-of-school children and youth in the community who may be characterized as: living with disabilityies living in off-gridfar-flung community a barangay without a school or a geographically isolated area displaced due to natural disaster living in an armed conflict area or area with high level of criminalitydrug abuse having chronic illness or nutritional problems victim of child abuse or economic exploitation statelessundocumented in conflict with the law living on the streets and no longer in school but interested in going back to school.

DepEd said that the Early Registration policy prescribes that registrants must satisfy the eligibility rules. For Kindergarten only those who are five (5) years old on or before August 31 2020 are eligible for Grade 1 participants should have completed Kinder or Philippine Education Placement Test (PEPT) Passer for Kinder Lev

Wear more white and yellow too....the white will help protect against any nasty viruses by reflecting them energetically away and the yellow will shine light upon any anxieties or fears helping you to face all head on to overcome them plus encourage you to yank your power back and find courage in everything youre doing. 

The yellow energies are of the sun primarily being Leo astrologically symbolising the LION who is king of the matrix. Bathe in the suns energies whenever you can for at least a few minutes because important inspirational messages will be downloading to you via the rays.

Ive already posted elsewhere on my fb page ways you can protect yourselves from the latest health outbreak...the Coronavirus. Inbox me if you want to know more but one of the easiest and best things to do is increase your intake of Vitamin C to boost your immunity against it. You can even make your own capsules like I do so that you know theres no sh*t in them!! (Ill post links below in the comment section.)

Amongst many other beneficial health-related properties Vitamin C is also anti-ageing so even the most narcissistical ignorant and arrogant players might be persuaded to take it even if its only to help keep them alive long enough for them to continue pulling more easy prey into their claws to play around with use kill then toss aside for a while..... 

After all they need to learn why its NOT so good to do these things before they croak it so this is one way to ensure they wont have to experience pay-back karma so much in future lives if they are given enough time to be taught a lesson in this one! 

Anyway before leaving to go do the get fit again walk in a sacred safe place my friend Karen drove past then stopped with tears running down her face calling out to tell me that my dear neighbour and friend Betty died late Friday night aged 94! 

Betty was born in that huge detached house on the end with panoramic views of the Garth Caerphilly Rhiwbina Wenault and Lisvane mountains plus views of the Severm Estauary from the top floors and grew up in it. She returned with her GP husband and children when her parents died. She was also a caring GP loving mother grandmother great-great and great-great-great grandmother and other loving things to so many as well as a valued friend to people like me.

After trying to comfort Karen and promising to be here whenever needed she went back to attend to Bettys family whove come down from Scotland and I promised to be at the funeral in Llandaff Cathedral.

Karen owns a farm up in the Valleys and holds a high-up position with the Welsh National Farmers Union (NFU) but spent a lot of time living with her best friend Betty taking constant care of her as she gradually became more frail. Karen was present holding Bettys hand when she passed over peacefully in her very own home on the 31st January 2020. 

Most folk wouldnt have cared so much and sent older relatives and friends into a Nursing Home! Karen needs lots of love and care herself right now!! I intend to be there for her.

So this sparked off the topic of death I discuss in the driving video I filmed today. Betty died at the end of an era as we enter a new one...

The UK has now finally left the EU (European Union) and I started re-decorating cleansing and rearranging my home as time led to its penultimate moment while many others got irate listening to the countdown on the main-stream-media. 

The 1st February used to mean the first day of Spring in olden days such as Imbolc and the Feast of St Brigdid. Now it equates to new beginnings and in this case currently New DIMENSIONS

Matagal na ang CORONAVIRUS.
1960s pa yan na-discover.
Nakakalat yan. Lumulutang.
Kaya huwag mag panic.?
7 ang HUMAN STRAINS niyan.
3 ang DEADLY una yung SARS 2nd yung MERS at 3rd itong bago kaya NOVEL ang tawag.
NOVEL means BAGO.

Ang tinamaan sa 3 VIRUS na yan ay MATATANDA MGA BATA at yung mahina ang resistensiyameaning STRESSED kulang sa TULOG di KUMAKAIN NG MAAYOS 
(puro kanin at karne walang GULAY).
Mahina ang IMMUNE SYSTEM. 
Ang pinakamadaling tamaan ay yung KULANG SA NUTRITION.

Pag tinamaan ka nitong VIRUS na ito ang sapol is your RESPIRATORY SYSTEM.Kasi diyan dumadaan ang VIRUS. 7-14 days ang INCUBATION nito.
So may chance ang katawan mo if you are HEALTHY & FIT na.

LABANAN ang VIRUS.
Ang VIRUS pag nilalabanan ng katawan mo ang effect is SAME SA TRANGKASO o FLU.

Walang gamot sa VIRUS (sa ngayon)
Hindi ANTI-BIOTIC ang ginagamit. 
Kasi pang BACTERIAL INFECTION lang yun.
Ang pwede nating gawin ay
AYUSIN ang HYGIENE.
Maghugas ng KAMAY lagi.
Huwag kalikutin ang MATA at ILONG at BIBIG.
Huwag pumunta sa mga CLINIC at HOSPITAL kung di naman kailangan.
Avoid CROWDED PLACES like ELEVATORS HOLDING ROOMS etc.
Pwede ka gumamit ng MASK.
(Kasi naman mga tao dito kahit may SIPON at UBO pumapasok pa?)
Next is MATULOG ng MAAGA (di pumapayat ang nag-pupuyat)
KUMAIN ng MAAYOS
mag SUPPLEMENT
mag-EXERCISE REGULARLY (exercise builds-up your IMMUNE SYSTEM). Yan ang mga kailangan whether may NOVEL CORONAVIRUS o wala.

Kaya always do a proper hygiene at ayusin ang sarili dapat laging happy and eat nutritious foods and most importantly ALWAYS PRAY? 

Masuwerte din tayo sa Pilipinas dahil tropical country tayo dahil kapag nabilad ang Novel Corona Virus ng matagal sa araw ito ay mamamatay at hindi tatagal. 

Kailangan nang pag iingat at pag pag aalaga sa sarili ng tama. 

GOD BLESS US ALL!

Palakasin ang Immune system with BETA-CRYPTOXANTHIN in BUAH MERAH. Ayon sa DOH maganda ding uminon o kumain nang Malunggay. Ang Essensa Buah Merah Mix Bottle ay nag  din nang Malunggay.

Poor people are starving & you have this..
By the request of Mr. Keshe from the Keshe Foundation to help to eradicate this national problem which is endangering the national food security in China the followers of Keshe Foundation in China started to look for small farmers who could have animals which had caught the virus so that the new plasma technology could be tested. In this process a pig affected by this disease was located in mid-November and the plasma water newly developed by M.T. Keshe was shipped to the location on 22nd of November 2018. On Friday morning of 23rd of November the first plasma water was fed to the pig.
Within the first 12 hours the pig shows a clear first stage of recovery and the second day was fed for the first time with cooked food which she refused to eat since affected. By the third day the ears have risen from the folded position. By the fourth day after three months the pig produced the first excrement. From the outset of starting this process Mr. Keshe explained to the farmer that the only way we know the virus has cleared out of the body was if the pig produces the first excrement. That shows the body has gone back to the full operation and the virus is eradicated. This proves the correctness of applying the new plasma water for the eradication of the virus.

Good Morning. In today’s edition the coronavirus outbreak isolates China and tests the global economy President Trump turns his focus to his re-election bid BlackRocks very public firing of executives and the Kansas City Chiefs win the Super Bowl.

?? Happening Today: 

    Earnings include: Alphabet Sysco and Hartford Financial Services Group
    Iowa caucuses kick off 2020 election

What’s on the Impeachment Agenda:

    The trial resumes at 11 a.m. for four hours of arguments

 
1.

The coronavirus outbreak is isolating China from the rest of the world. Rarely has such an integral part of the global economic system faced such an abrupt and open-ended freeze out. The consequences are beginning to be felt. Uncertainty over the virus—which has infected more than 17000 people as of Sunday—is disrupting worldwide trade and supply chains depressing asset prices and forcing multinational businesses to make hard decisions with limited information.

China’s health crisis is testing the entire global economic system and placing unexpected and additional strain on the fragility of an extended boom. It’s also a test of China’s strength as a consumer—and the U.S.’s ability to step up as China lags.

    Chinese markets reopened after the extended Lunar New Year Break and dropped sharply due to heightened anxiety over the fast-spreading virus and its impact on the global economy.

    A new hospital built in 10 days was completed Sunday in Wuhan one of two going up to treat virus patients in the city at the center of the outbreak.

    Public-health experts around the world have been crunching numbers about the advance of the coronavirus to estimate how far and fast it could spread.

    Saudi Arabia is pushing for a drastic short-term oil production cut as it seeks to respond to the effects of the virus on crude demand according to OPEC officials.

An emboldened President Trump turned his focus to his re-election bid arguing that a growing economy would help him in November while Democrats’ lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff vowed to press for the president’s removal.

The televised comments by Messrs. Trump and Schiff came just ahead of the Iowa caucuses Monday the State of the Union address Tuesday and the expected acquittal of Mr. Trump by the Senate on Wednesday. They also came as new polling showed voters’ views of him were little changed by his impeachment.

    The reverberations of impeachment will roll out for years to come including deeper polarization an ever-more powerful executive and a Republican Party inextricably joined to the president writes Gerald F. Seib.

    A campaign that began more than a year ago for Iowas Democratic presidential caucuses is drawing to a frenzied close as a flood of candidate appearances and ads blanket the state before Monday’s balloting starts the nomination season.

    In dozens of interviews across the state Iowa Democrats said a top concern was which candidate would be best positioned to limit President Trump’s tenure in the Oval Office to one term.

WeWork has taken its first significant step in the post-Adam Neumann era naming a new chief executive officer to run a company whose challenges abound. Real-estate-industry veteran Sandeep Mathrani is to take over this month a critical move in the company’s bid to rebuild after a failed IPO attempt and the departure of Mr. Neumann its co-founder and former chairman and CEO.

Mr. Mathrani will work closely with Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure who is also a senior official at WeWork owner SoftBank. Their challenge will be nothing less than pulling the company out of a big hole dug by Mr. Neumann and SoftBank as they pursued a growth-at-all-costs strategy in the run-up to the attempted listing.

When BlackRock fired two executives last year who had romantic relationships with subordinates the money-management giant didn’t do it quietly. The firm ousted both leaders announcing they had broken company rules in memos that were sent to BlackRock’s roughly 16000 employees. Senior executives and board members discussed the matters and wanted to send a clear message to employees customers and the public according to people familiar with the decision.

The public firings reflect a firm determined to show it will police its own workplace. BlackRock faces new demands from the public as the shareholder votes it controls and its responsibilities as a corporate watchdog grow. Like other big companies the giant asset manager also has to address expectations of a younger generatio

What I am gonna share is all based on what I have seen and experienced in the past two weeks. 
    I don’t remember when exactly the virus situation got started but it is said that the first case was found in Wuhan in December. Wuhan is the capital city of Hubei province which is located in the south of China. It was said that the first case was found in the early December and then more cases showed up and some medical staff even got infected. But the government there didn‘t take it seriously and even said in public that the virus would not spread from person to person. And later it turned out that it can spread from animals to humans and humans to humans as well. And the original cause of this virus was from a wildlife market in Wuhan. People there eat a lot of wild animals. It’s said that the virus was originally from wild bats and some fucking stupid humans ate them and got infected.
    I came back to my parents’ from Qingdao where I am working on Jan. 20th. And I remember at that time I hadn‘t heard anything about the coronavirus and I just took a high-speed train to get home without any protection like wearing a mask. And after I came back to my parents’ news about the coronavirus started to spread and it went viral so did the virus. On Jan 23rd there were only about 400 cases confirmed in China and now 17335 confirmed 21558 suspected 361 died and 509 were cured. Most cases are in Wuhan but right now every province in China has some cases reported. I didn’t realize how serious it was until i heard the news that the whole Wuhan city was shut down by the government at 2 am on Jan 23rd. But still before the city was blocked there were about 5 million people who had already left Wuhan some of whom carried the virus without knowing it. And you can imagine how many more people will get infected through those infected people. And there were also some people trying to escape from Wuhan after it was shut down and some of them even made it. 
    On Jan 24th was the eve of Chinese New Year and we still had some celebration like paying a visit to the graveyard. Then henan province suddenly became famous because of its super strict restrictions about people’s going out. And one or two days later the province where i am started to take some similar measures to restrict people’s outside activities. I am currently at my parents’ and they live in a village in Weifang. All the main roads leading to other villages are blocked and no cars can get through. No one is going out and everyone stays indoors all day. Luckily this is a time when we all celebrate new year so we have stored some food in advance. But still some people are short of food or something for daily use because of which some markets and small shops are empty now. And most small shops are actually closed as well. We are trying to avoid going out as possible. My sister went to the town market today to get some vegetables and she wore a mask a pair of gloves and a helmet. Before she got inside the market someone there tested her temperature. She was very careful and she even wore some worn out clothes on purpose so that she would just throw away those clothes after getting back. You may wonder how she got out of the village to the town since the village was blocked. Well she rode an e-bike which can pass the blocked road easily. But still when she came back she was not allowed to get in so she had to find some other narrow roads to sneak in. 
    The government had extended the new year holiday to stop migration so that the situation can be in better control. For companies the employees got three more days off. But for students the holiday is a lot longer now. According to the government all the kindergartens primary and middle schools can not open until February 17th and all the universities cannot open until February 24th. And it may get longer depending on the virus situation. 
    The situation in Wuhan is really really really serious and it’s beyond our imagination. Some of the doctors and nurses there don’t even have protective medical equipment. And some doctors and nurses broke down because of long time working. The government has sent a lot of experts and doctors there and even built a new hospital there within days. Hope we can get over this as soon as possible.","100007109266907_2524109807835970","mfjhunter"

I think the jury is still very out on what level this will be. But I think as days go on it’s becoming more likely than not it will be a pandemic. The first real one since 1918. Now yeah we have better screening and medical care etc now. But at some point if it spreads enough it will matter less and less. The United Sates healthcare system is already always running at stress level as is. If it became overwhelmed then millions could not get the care that would make that difference we have vs 1918. I don’t “think” this thing would be a 25% mortality killer. But then again MERS is in the same family and has a 30 plus % mortality rate. Luckily MERS doesn’t spread that good. If MERS spread as good as this Coronavirus on my that would have been horrendous. One thing most people don’t know is the 1918 pandemic started mild at first. It had 3 waves. Mild cases that were highly infectious then once if spread enough the second wave was far more deadly then a third wave where cases dropped massively after a VERY deadly peak from the 2nd wave. They tapered off until by Summer of 1919 it was officially over. It was a slow burn . So what it did was start mild so it could go undetected and spread and infect many. If it’s overly aggressive and deadly then it can burn its self out fast. Then once it established a foot hold it possibly mutated and with combined stress to medical system it became far more deadly. Then it peaked by this time it had killed between 50-100 million people. In today’s numbers it would have been possibly as high as 700 million adjusted for population. Then it has infected so many by the third wave it either killed those most susceptible to it and those left were recovered from it and had immunity and so it just burned out. This starting out “mild” compared to its cousins SARS and MERS might not be a good thing. It just might be the thing that helps it do what it’s cousins couldn’t... become a pandemic and kill millions.","10157012640636623_10157014270151623",

I wanted to reach out to you with some important updates as we are in the midst of gearing up for the spring and even next school year. I hope you all are enjoying this relatively mild winter to this point. I am optimistic but I also remember that we live in Michigan and we could get all of our winter snow in a short period of time!  In any event hopefully we will be able to keep things rolling with a relatively mild end to our winter months here. Here are 4 important updates:

1.    School District Calendars - We have successfully worked with our teachers and have agreed to school calendars for the 2020-21 and 2021-22 school years.  I really appreciate the collaborative spirit that we have with our teachers who work so hard and do so much for our kids. We also know that while it seems like a long way off many families are looking to start their planning for the next couple of years. I hope that this will help in some of your planning and give you plenty of advanced notice.

2.    3rd Grade Reading Law - Many of you are aware of the legislative changes over the past few years that requires that students be reading at grade level by the time they get to 3rd grade in order to avoid retention. We have been implementing many high-quality literacy improvement systems over the last 3-4 years and have been seeing some very strong results. However even with sound systems there is still a group of students who struggle with their reading. My message to you about this even though you may hear different things in the media is that we always have and will continue to work with your child. If you have any concerns that your child may be impacted by this law we will have already been in communication with you about this.  We have many robust tools at our disposal that allow us to work with children that may be impacted by this law and we are ready and prepared to meet all of the requirements. Furthermore regardless of the law we want all kids to be able to read by 3rd grade as well so we are continuing to analyze our practice around this. If you have any questions or concerns please reach out to your child’s teacher and principal.

3.    CoronavirusGeneral Flu Guidance - Due to the heightened concern globally I thought it would be good to share with our families some information that was shared with me from the Genesee County Health Department about Coronavirus as well as the common flu. There are no individual measures or actions being recommended for individuals in the general US population in relation to coronavirus as of this email.  Of course if new information comes in or recommendations change we will let you know.  GCHD recommends encouraging students parents and staff to take everyday preventative actions to stop the spread of germs. These preventative actions can help reduce the spread of many germsviruses and prevent respiratory illnesses like flu RSV etc. People can protect themselves and others from illness by the following:  

o    Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
o    Get a flu shot every year. It is not too late to get your flu shot.
o    Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with germs like flu.
o    Avoid touching your eyes nose and mouth. Germs spread this way.
o     Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available use an alcohol-based hand rub.
o    Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze. After using a tissue throw it in the trash and wash your hands.
o    Stay home when sick. CDC recommends that you stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone except to get medical care or for other necessities. (Your fever should be gone for 24 hours without the use of a fever-reducing medicine.)
o    While sick limit contact with others as much as possible to keep from infecting them.

Influenza activity remains high in Michigan with Influenza B and H1N1 strains predominating. We recommend encouraging hand hygienerespiratory etiquette staying home when ill avoiding close contact with people who are sick and getting the flu shot (as it is not too late and there are likely several weeks of flu season left). The district has been working overtime to disinfect our learning spaces where children sit each day in the evenings. However your help is greatly appreciated as we work our way through this season.

4.    Upcoming Dates to Remember - Lastly I wanted to remind you about Elementary PT Conferences this week on Thursday from 1-3:30 pm and 5-7:00 pm.  Additionally we will have a mid-winter break this year on February 14-17 where we will not have school on that Friday (214) or Monday (217).

Thank you all for your support and have a great week!

Sincerely

Gilead had said Jan. 31 that it is working with Chinese authorities to test its investigational antiviral remdesivir as a treatment for coronavirus infections.

There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for the novel virus which was first identified in December in Wuhan China. Since then at least 361 people have died and 17205 have been sickened.

By the request of Mr. Keshe from the Keshe Foundation to help to eradicate this national problem which is endangering the national food security in China the followers of Keshe Foundation in China started to look for small farmers who could have animals which had caught the virus so that the new plasma technology could be tested. In this process a pig affected by this disease was located in mid-November and the plasma water newly developed by M.T. Keshe was shipped to the location on 22nd of November 2018. On Friday morning of 23rd of November the first plasma water was fed to the pig.
Within the first 12 hours the pig shows a clear first stage of recovery and the second day was fed for the first time with cooked food which she refused to eat since affected. By the third day the ears have risen from the folded position. By the fourth day after three months the pig produced the first excrement. From the outset of starting this process Mr. Keshe explained to the farmer that the only way we know the virus has cleared out of the body was if the pig produces the first excrement. That shows the body has gone back to the full operation and the virus is eradicated. This proves the correctness of applying the new plasma water for the eradication of the virus.

Chinese authorities emphasized the treatment of patients and the supply of medical resources at a high-level meeting on the novel coronavirus prevention and control on Wednesday.

The meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang noted that the prevention and control efforts are in full swing and have been intensified but the epidemic keeps spreading with a rapid rising trend in some regions.

The situation remains grim and complex according to the meeting of the leading group of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee on the prevention and control of the outbreak of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus with Li as the head.

Targeted measures must be taken to curb the spread of the epidemic in the country the meeting stressed adding that further epidemic prevention and control should be carried out in central Chinas Hubei Province and Wuhan the provincial capital and center of the coronavirus outbreak.

The meeting required dispersed clinical reception and centralized treatment and severe patients should be sent to hospitals of best conditions or attended to by intensive-care experts.

Noting that the development of vaccines should be sped up the meeting also demanded to step up approval for medicines which initially proved effective in clinical research for extensive use as soon as possible.

Stressing all-out efforts to ensure the supply of medical resources the meeting asked local administrations to organize enterprises to resume the production of resources including medical protective clothing masks and medicines.

Local authorities are required to guide logistic enterprises including e-commerce entities to smooth delivery according to the meeting.

The supply of daily necessities and vegetables in key areas was emphasized at the meeting.

The meeting also stressed efforts of epidemic prevention and control amid the return trips of people after the Lunar New Year holiday adding that proper postponement of return should be allowed.

Methods such as ventilation and sterilization at public transportation vehicles stations and ports should be implemented it said.

Delays in business operation and school opening should be applied among other necessary measures in Hubei Province and other places facing relatively serious epidemic.

The term coronavirus is the general category of viruses that include a variety of viruses that range from the come common cold viruses to MERS and SARS.  Most coronaviruses are not dangerous.  

The present species of coronavirus presents symptoms that are very similar to the flu  cough fever sore throat runny nose aches and pains and in more serious cases pneumonia etc.  Those with pre-existing conditions especially lung disease are particularly vulnerable to any virus that attacks the respiratory system.

Andanar asks public ‘not to panic’ says gov’t on top of situation

As the country recorded its first case of the novel coronavirus the government has appealed to the public “not to panic” and assured them about intensified measures to curb the spread of the illness.

Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said the government has stepped up stringent customs immigration and quarantine measures against the virus.

“With the first confirmed case of the 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) we ask the public not to panic and to remain calm as the government especially the Department of Health (DOH) is on top of the situation. We would like to assure them that the relevant health research and law enforcement agencies are working together to prevent the disease from spreading” he said in a statement Thursday.

“Let’s continue to remain calm and heed the advisories of the DOH and the rest of the government on the matter as we continue to monitor such developments and take the appropriate actions in dealing with the 2019-nCoV.”

The health department earlier on Thursday announced that a 38-year-old Chinese woman tested positive for the virus. The patient traveled to the country last Jan. 21 from Wuhan where the virus outbreak started.

No ban on Chinese travelers has been ordered by the government so far despite calls from concerned groups.

Andanar said the DOH is working closely with health and research authorities in Australia Japan and China on efforts to contain the coronavirus. “In fact with the help of our counterparts in Japan we are now capable of detecting and diagnosing 2019-nCoV-infected patients on our own.”

The government has also intensified “containment measures and the necessary precautionary measures” to address the latest health concern Andanar said.

“With the continuous inflow of travelers coming from affected areas in China we will continue to conduct necessary stringent customs immigration and quarantine measures to prevent the disease from spreading within the country.”

To Filipinos staying in China Andanar said the government would coordinate with Chinese authorities to repatriate nationals “as needed.”

A coronavirus hotline will also be established to help Filipinos abroad including those living in China with virus prevention and countermeasures.

Andanar meanwhile urged the public to observe health advisories issued by the DOH to prevent infection.

 
“Let us also observe proper hygiene and cleanliness in order to prevent the likelihood of contracting the virus. Please remain vigilant and coordinate with your local barangay health centers should you observe symptoms associated with the 2019-nCoV.”

Viruses often spark panic. But the coronavirus has spread something else besides misinformation and false rumors: xenophobia and anti-China sentiment.

As she walks through campus and sits in class Rosen Huynh tries extra hard to suppress her coughs.
Fear of the coronavirus which was first detected in December in China has spread around the world and many people like Huynh are suddenly hyperaware of their East Asian roots. Every cough every wheeze the 22-year-old says seems to elicit furtive glances and odd looks.
I dont know if its just people looking at me coughing or because Im an Asian person coughing they think I might have the coronavirus” said Huynh who lives in Monterey Park. I feel like every time I cough people are going to be uncomfortable with that. I shouldnt have to feel that way.
Viruses often spark panic. But the coronavirus has spread something else besides misinformation and false rumors: xenophobia and anti-China sentiment. People have fielded vitriolic attacks in public spaces including suspicious looks and nasty comments they’ve seen others scrambling to avoid them. 
Taking Calc 151 with only Asians in the classroom ... I hope I dont catch coronavirus ... thinkin about dropping this class now a student wrote on his Snapchat story. A doctor in Ontario said her son was cornered at school by children who wanted to test him for the virus just because he is half-Chinese. 
The new coronavirus which can cause respiratory illness and pneumonia has infected at least 17348 people worldwide killing at least 362 of them as of Sunday night with only one death outside China. Eleven cases have been confirmed in the United States including six in California.
False health information including warnings to avoid Asian food and Asian-populated areas has circulated and videos of Asian people eating bats accompanied by inaccurate speculation about the cause of the virus and dehumanizing comments have gone viral. A barrage of vicious discussion and derogatory jokes about Chinese people or Asians in general have gathered steam online drawing on age-old racist tropes associating Chinese people with disease filth and dirty food experts say.
Some in California felt their fears of racism around the virus were confirmed last week when UC Berkeley’s health services center listed xenophobia toward Asian people as a normal reaction in an informational post on Instagram focused on managing fears and anxiety about the pneumonia-like sickness.
The campus received a flood of criticism for the post.
“Feeling good about the light fear people have had of me in public all week campus alum Michelle Lee wrote sarcastically in a tweet.
The post was “blatant and awful” in its harm to people of color and remarkable considering more than 40% of last years freshman class was Asian said Angie Chen legislative aide for a Berkeley City Council member and recent alum of the university.
People can feel nervous thats valid” she said. But grouping in xenophobia with all the other things like anxiety and helplessness legitimizes these responses to the virus.”","100008943007343_2222954718012607","rudystime"

The spectacle would help him charge up the political base he needs to turn out in droves in 2020 with claims their 2016 votes were being stolen by political elites.”

            Give that man whatever passes for a cigar in this smokeless age.

            Any number of metaphors serves to illustrate the unintended effect that the hapless failed impeachment of Donald Trump is having on his base of support. What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger the Democrats did just that with an attack that didn’t stand a chance of felling its target.

            If you’re thinking about taking a swing at a bully at a bar be sure you can deliver a roundhouse punch that’s going to lay the bastard out flat on the floor. But if you don’t have what it takes to bring him down with the first blow sneak out to the parking lot.

            The coronavirus outbreak has me thinking about disease. There’s a medical metaphor that I like best: when fighting off an infection it’s better not to use any medication than to take a weak antibiotic and risk strengthening what ails you.

            No matter the analogy President Trump emerges from his Senate impeachment trial as a more formidable adversary than he was before. While his overall popularity remains at about 46% the number of voters who “strongly” support him just hit a three-year high indicating that he is better off than before impeachment. This should come to the surprise of no one who remembers the humiliation of Bill Clinton. Republican overreach over Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky led to the Democrat leaving office in 2000 with soaring popularity.

            Probably the biggest movement in favor of Trump has been with formerly “anti-Trump Republicans” who now see the truth of the President’s supporters’ claims that Democrats would do and say anything in order to get rid of a sitting Republican president. The ranks of Never Trumpers are shrinking throwing a wrench into the strategy of centrist candidates like Biden and Buttigieg.

            Polls in key swing states show disproportionately high disapproval for impeachment. Voters in these places tend to prefer antiestablishment candidates. Impeachment allows Trump to frame himself as the rebel getting picked on by the in-crowd Congressional Democrats.

            Impeachment — more specifically this very lame rushed pro forma impeachment — also dispirits Democratic voters who see once again that the Democratic Party only seems to wage wars it knows it can’t win. What’s the point of voting for these clowns?

            One thing is for sure: no matter what perfidy is discovered or comes to light in the future it’s going to be all but impossible to take a second stab at impeachment. Now Trump really could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get away with it. Impeaching the same President twice is all but inconceivable.

            How did this happen? Democrats made one mistake after another.

            First and foremost was the lousy choice of impeachment counts. Pressuring Ukraine to investigate the Bidens looked and felt too much like political business as usual not a breach of normality so outrageous as to justify removal from office. Shades of Rob Blagojevich former governor of Illinois.

            The Ukraine line of inquiry prompted as many questions as it tried to ask. If Trump is corrupt what about the Bidens? Why were we giving aid to Ukraine in the first place when millions of Americans are homeless or poor? Why should Americans care about Ukraine? The country certainly isn’t as Democrats alleged important to American national security.

            A slim majority thought the Ukraine call was wrong. But they didn’t care enough to impeach him over it.

            Americans did care about emoluments and the president using his office to enrich himself. They did care about his wacko temperament and erratic behavior. They did care about separating children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. Inexplicably the Democrats let the good bad stuff go.

            Democrats screwed up badly with timing. You don’t have to be James Carville to know that it’s foolish to start an impeachment trial at the beginning of a presidential election campaign. You certainly don’t do it when many of your big-name candidates are senators who can’t campaign because they are stuck in Washington. Yet that’s exactly what Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff did.

            Starting the impeachment process so late in Trump’s first term forced Democrats into a rushed pro-forma process. Because Trump Administration officials broadcasted their intention to resist congressional subpoenas and the courts might have taken months to compel them to testify Democra

TECH READIES FOR THE START OF VOTING IN 2020 — Tech companies have spent years readying for the 2020 presidential election — including putting an array of policies and safeguards in place to try to avoid a repeat of 2016 when the world’s leading social platforms were used as vehicles for foreign meddling — and February is shaping up to be a key litmus test for how they’re doing on election security.

Experts have warned that the threat of misinformation and disinformation is only going to increase as we get closer to Election Day in November. And even before that we may see an uptick in both as the Democratic field shrinks to just a few front-runners.

Here’s what the tech giants are focused on with the Iowa caucuses kicking off today and the New Hampshire primary around the corner:

— Facebook says it has beefed up its elections operations center at its headquarters in Menlo Park with threat investigators engineers data scientists and others tasked with monitoring the company’s platforms for unusual activity identifying and removing violations and deterring repeat offenders. The center which the company has said will stay active during all the caucuses and primaries plans to communicate directly with the national political committees individual campaigns and state elections officials on issues that arise. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also stressed that “we now have over 35000 people working on security” triple the size of those teams in 2016.

— Twitter last week turned on a tool to help spot and take down misinformation aimed at suppressing 2020 voter turnout. Twitter’s director of public policy and philanthropy Carlos Monje Jr. told MT that the company has “built the largest public database of state-backed information operations so the public can see this content up close and learn from researchers.”

— Google’s vice president of trust and safety Kristie Canegallo is out this morning with a memo reiterating the search giant’s global work “to monitor account hijackings inauthentic activity disinformation campaigns coordinated attacks and other forms of abuse on our platforms on a 247 basis… That’s why we’ve developed policies that prohibit deceptive practices and abuse such as voter suppression.” (Google Play has for example “implemented new policies to mitigate misleading claims and promote transparency about the sources of government information including voting information communicated through apps” the executive wrote.) She also stressed Google’s collaboration with government agencies and law enforcement to share information about suspicious activity as well as free “Protect Your Election” tools for campaigns politicians and journalists.

— Google-owned YouTube has pledged to “enforce our policies consistently without regard to a video’s political viewpoint” YouTube’s vice president of government affairs and public policy Leslie Miller wrote in a memo out this morning. She also emphasized that YouTube’s community guidelines do not allow deceptive election-related material including content meant to mislead or deter voters as well as certain kinds of manipulated media.

Fear of coronavirus fuels racist sentiment targeting Asians

_____
As she walks through campus and sits in class Rosen Huynh tries extra hard to suppress her coughs.

Fear of the coronavirus which was first detected in December in China has spread around the world and many people like Huynh are suddenly hyperaware of their East Asian roots. Every cough every wheeze the 22-year-old says seems to elicit furtive glances and odd looks.

“I don’t know if it’s just people looking at me coughing or because I’m an Asian person coughing they think I might have the coronavirus” said Huynh who lives in Monterey Park. “I feel like every time I cough people are going to be uncomfortable with that. I shouldn’t have to feel that way.”

Viruses often spark panic. But the coronavirus has spread something else besides misinformation and false rumors: xenophobia and anti-China sentiment. People have fielded vitriolic attacks in public spaces including suspicious looks and nasty comments they’ve seen others scrambling to avoid them.

“Taking Calc 151 with only Asians in the classroom ... I hope I don’t catch coronavirus ... thinkin about dropping this class now” a student wrote on his Snapchat story. A doctor in Ontario said her son was cornered at school by children who wanted to “test” him for the virus just because he is half-Chinese.

The new coronavirus which can cause respiratory illness and pneumonia has infected at least 17348 people worldwide killing at least 362 of them as of Sunday night with only one death outside China. Eleven cases have been confirmed in the United States including six in California.

False health information including warnings to avoid Asian food and Asian-populated areas has circulated and videos of Asian people eating bats accompanied by inaccurate speculation about the cause of the virus and dehumanizing comments have gone viral. A barrage of vicious discussion and derogatory jokes about Chinese people or Asians in general have gathered steam online drawing on age-old racist tropes associating Chinese people with disease filth and dirty food experts say.

Some in California felt their fears of racism around the virus were confirmed last week when UC Berkeley’s health services center listed xenophobia toward Asian people as a “normal reaction” in an informational post on Instagram focused on “managing fears and anxiety” about the pneumonia-like sickness.

The campus received a flood of criticism for the post.

“Feeling good about the light fear people have had of me in public all week” campus alum Michelle Lee wrote sarcastically in a tweet.

The post was “blatant and awful” in its harm to people of color and remarkable considering more than 40% of last year’s freshman class was Asian said Angie Chen legislative aide for a Berkeley City Council member and recent alum of the university.

“People can feel nervous that’s valid” she said. “But grouping in xenophobia with all the other things like anxiety and helplessness legitimizes these responses to the virus.”

Amid backlash the university deleted the post and apologized. “We regret any misunderstanding it may have caused and have updated the language in our materials” read a statement shared by the Tang Center on Friday.

Aida Zhu 21 who was about to board a flight back home to San Diego saw an agent with the Transportation Security Administration staring at her as she shuffled through security at William P. Hobby Airport in Houston while wearing a mask.

“I hope you’re not ill” he said to her in a disgusted tone.

Zhu said she’s been mulling over the incident all week. She thinks racist sentiment has been latent. “The coronavirus is bringing it to the surface.”

Andrew Nguyen 22 an employee at Aape a retail clothing store in West Hollywood was ringing a customer up last week when the man gave him a dirty look. Nguyen reached into the bag to scan the tag on the mask the man was purchasing — the type of face mask meant to be fashionable not a medical one — his fingers brushing the cloth.

The man brusquely said “Can you get me a new one?”

“Why?” Nguyen shot back.

“Because you touched it” the man responded.

It happened when videos of Asian people eating exotic meats were going around Nguyen said. “I felt like maybe he had seen one of those.”

Reading the vitriolic comments on news articles about the virus has taken a toll on 26-year-old Katherine Lu. She’s not worried about experiencing racism in person however since she lives in Los Angeles and rarely takes public transit.

Canadian-based UN agency(ICAO the International Civil Aviation Organization) under fire after Twitter spat about coronavirus 
Amid the fight to contain the coronavirus outbreak a Canadian-based arm of the United Nations has found itself facing allegations of censorship as well as appeasement of China’s Communist government.
The online row is the latest flashpoint in a long-standing debate around Taiwan — the self-ruled island considered by China to be one of its wayward provinces — one which Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has freshly waded into.
This week the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) which is based in Montreal blocked numerous critics on Twitter who were voicing calls for Taiwan and Taiwanese experts to be included in discussions around the outbreak of a new coronavirus.
In one case a consultant was surprised to find he was blocked after only retweeting another user’s post calling for Taiwan’s participation.
Melbourne-based journalist Mike Yeo said he was blocked immediately after commenting that the volume of people being blocked made the UN agency seem “thin-skinned while their action towards Taiwan counterproductive to aviation safety.”

Plans for New Airtanker Base in Colorado Springs

The City of Colorado Springs and the United States Forest Service recently announced plans to build a new permanent airtanker base and ramp at the Colorado Springs Airport. Our firefighters in Colorado and around the country risk everything to protect our communities and it is our duty to make sure they have every possible tool at their disposal to safely fight wildfires. I’m excited to welcome this new airtanker base and ramp at the Colorado Springs Airport which will serve as an incredible resource for the brave firefighters in Colorado and our surrounding areas.

Happy Birthday Colorado National Guard

On January 23rd the Colorado National Guard turned 160 years old. Thank you to all of the past and present members of our Colorado National Guard for 160 years of dedicated service! We are proud of your heroic work each and every day.

The BLM Works for the West
When it comes to managing our state’s treasured lands it’s time for a little less D.C. influence and a little more Colorado common sense. As a fifth-generation Coloradan I believe in Colorado and Grand Junction and I believe we are up to the task of being home to the BLM Headquarters. The great outdoors are part of who we are as Coloradans. We champion groundbreaking research into new alternative energy methods and technology to improve the environment and we take immense pride that people from all over the world come to Colorado to enjoy our state’s beauty. Read my op-ed in the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel on why Grand Junction is the perfect location for the BLM’s headquarters.

Remembering the Horrors of the Holocaust

Seventy-five years ago this week liberation arrived at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. On International Holocaust Remembrance Day we remembered the horrors of the Holocaust and the six million Jewish people who were murdered.

Wuhan Coronavirus Update

Upon learning of the coronavirus outbreak in China I contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department to ensure Congress is prepared to serve as a collaborative partner in a successful response. At my urging the U. S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and Health Labor Education and Pensions held a briefing from a top public health official and I stand ready to help local and state officials respond if the need arises.

Congratulations to a Senate Page from Colorado Springs

Join me in congratulating Jennifer St. George from Colorado Springs on finishing the United States Senate Page Program! Jennifer represented Colorado as a Senate Page and I wish her the best in her future endeavors. High school students interested in applying to the U.S. Senate Page Program can find more information on my website. This program provides an excellent opportunity for students to learn about Congress while living working and attending classes for a semester in Washington D.C.

Colorado Unemployment Rate Hits Historic Low

Colorado’s unemployment rate reached a historic low as pro-growth policies are delivering for workers. In December Colorado’s unemployment rate dipped to 2.5 percent the lowest in more than 40 years and 1 percent lower than the national average. According to Ryan Gedney a senior economist with the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment “we’re seeing people find jobs that are a great fit for them and also we’re seeing really strong wage gains.” I’m proud of the great economic success we have achieved in Colorado and I’ll continue to fight for policies that allow every corner of Colorado to grow and thrive.

Firefighter with Colorado Ties Killed in Australia Wildfires

I’m saddened to hear of the loss of firefighter Ian McBeth a graduate of Wray High School Class of ’94 who was killed while volunteering in Australia fighting the wildfires. My family and I are sending our deepest condolences to his loved ones and brave firefighters everywhere.

China Jails Student for Exercising Basic Freedoms

China’s vision for a less free and open world has reached our shores. The Chinese Communist Party has now imprisoned a University of Minnesota student for practicing the most basic freedoms we cherish in the United States. The United States government has made clear through my Asia Reassurance Initiative Act that we will stand for a free and open Indo-Pacific where democracy and human rights are respected. I’m calling on the rest of the world to join us and open their eyes to the China threat.

HONG KONG—The new coronavirus that has spread consternation around the world over the last few weeks has now killed more people in China than the SARS epidemic of 2002-2003. China’s health commission reported Sunday that there were 361 deaths nationwide. During the SARS outbreak 349 people died in mainland China and 774 altogether around the world. The Chinese stock markets took major hits Monday and the whole nation feels its growing isolation.
Three New Cases of Coronavirus Confirmed in California

Yet last December—before people all over China began falling sick with pneumonia-like symptoms before people around the world grew alarmed about a disease leaping from captured wild animals to human shoppers in dense Chinese food markets and before the coronavirus reached new shores after being carried onto planes by human hosts forcing the World Health Organization to declare a global emergency—eight people discussed how several patients in Wuhan were experiencing severe rapid breakdowns in their respiratory systems.

They were part of a medical school’s alumni group on WeChat a popular social network in China and they were concerned that SARS Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome was back. 

It wasn’t long before police detained them. The authorities said these eight doctors and medical technicians were “misinforming” the public that there was no SARS that the information was obviously wrong and that everyone in the city must remain calm. On the first day of 2020 Wuhan police said they had “taken legal measures” against the eight individuals who had “spread rumors.”
Since then the phenomenal spread of the virus has created cracks even within the normally united front of the Chinese Communist Party. “It might have been fortunate if the public had believed the ‘rumor’ and started to wear masks carry out sanitization measures and avoid the wild animal market” a judge of China’s Supreme People’s Court wrote online last Tuesday.
Li Wenliang a doctor who was among the eight people who tried to sound the alarm before the coronavirus infected many thousands and killed hundreds has been diagnosed as someone infected with the coronavirus and is being treated at a hospital.
As of 5 p.m. Monday the official tally of coronavirus damage runs at more than 17000 confirmed infections more than 21000 under observation and 361 dead. But the actual numbers must be far higher possibly by a considerable magnitude according to estimates by doctors in China and infectious-disease experts around the world.

Authorities are still actively censoring social-media posts and news articles that question the governments response to the outbreak. One Wuhan man Fang Bin uploaded footage of corpses in a van and a hospital in Wuhan and was then tracked down and taken into custody. His laptop was confiscated and he had to pedal for three hours on a bicycle to get home after he was questioned warned and released. His coronavirus video went viral.

The Chinese government is eager to project the image that everything is under control. Beijing pushed back the post-Lunar New Year opening of financial markets by a few days and traders returned to their posts Monday morning. The Shanghai Composite Index and Shenzhen Composite Index quickly dropped 8.7 percent and 8.6 percent respectively. By lunch time more than 2600 stocks had tripped regulator-imposed breakers after losing 10 percent in value. At market closing at 3 p.m. the indices were unable to recover from their nosedives.

This was the worst plummet in China’s markets since an equity bubble burst in 2015 and it isn’t difficult to see why. Schools have been closed indefinitely. Flights have been grounded and domestic travel has been limited or even halted. Office buildings restaurants and malls are empty. Public functions have been canceled. 

Overwhelmingly white-collar workers across the country are telecommuting. The country it seems is a network of ghost towns with wide boulevards and glass towers. Combined with the ongoing swine flu and a new outbreak of avian flu south of Wuhan the coronavirus is hitting China’s economy on many fronts.

Perhaps the most striking development in China is how borders became tangible. Villages towns and cities are physically blocked off from each other sometimes with local officials posted on roads to stop anyone except emergency relief personnel from passing through. Married couples who hail from different parts of the country have been separated if they chose to travel over the Lunar New Year as they returned home after the break local officials in some locations barred one spouse whoever is an “outlander” from entering city limits.

The coronavirus is isolating China from the rest of the world

WUHAN China — People desperate for treatment started descending on a new hospital that was mostly built in just 10 days to help cope with the outbreak of the new coronavirus in the central city of Wuhan on Monday.

Construction workers in hard hats medical staff in hazmat suits and men and women in army fatigues scrambled around the dusty site on Monday afternoon dodging moving trucks excavators and cranes. Workers were still trying to finish construction on the Huoshenshan Hospital — a name that means “Fire God Mountain” — even as the facility prepared to accept its first batch of patients the official state broadcaster China Central Television reported.

Xue Ying a resident of Wuhan had driven to the new hospital hoping to find help for his increasingly unwell cousin. But city officials and signs on checkpoints have said the hospital would not accept walk-ins. Admission was only for patients with officially confirmed coronavirus infections who were transferred from other facilities.

Here’s how the hospital built along the Zhiyin Lake came together.

Construction teams of 7000 workers with armies of trucks and excavators dug and scraped around the clock to complete the project. The city government is attempting a feat recalling the SARS epidemic of 2003 when Beijing built a hospital in a week.

For Beijing the facility would also serve as a potent symbol of the government’s drive to do what needs to be done.

The city government needed to build the makeshift hospital quickly using prefabricated units to ease a persistent shortage of hospital beds and medical supplies. Leaders pledged to build the 1000-bed complex in 10 days and vowed that another new 1600-bed hospital would be ready by Feb. 5.

Wuhan a city of 11 million has been eerily quiet since the authorities locked it down preventing residents from leaving and severely limiting public transportation and private cars. But the roads around the hospital building site were packed with cement mixers trucks and other construction vehicles.

Many migrant workers and suppliers of materials were roped in to build the complex. Workplace safety precautions included temperature checks to try to detect signs of coronavirus infections.

In a ceremony on Sunday Zhou Xianwang the mayor of Wuhan officially handed the new hospital over to the military which will be in charge of operations. Boxes containing ventilators and medical equipment lay piled on a sidewalk on Monday. Trees sat in large trucks ready to be unloaded. One volunteer offered free rides around the vast construction site on his flatbed tricycle. On a sign he had scrawled: “Go Wuhan! Go Fire God Mountain!”

Many patients and their relatives have been eagerly looking forward to the opening of the new coronavirus hospitals but on Monday some were disappointed.

Mr. Xue the resident who had driven to the hospital said his mother had recently died of what the hospital called “viral pneumonia” and though she was never tested he believed that she had the coronavirus. He said his aunt and uncle were also in a hospital.

“I can’t afford to lose anyone else” he said sitting dejectedly in the car with his cousin who was unwell.

By Monday evening Chinese state media were reporting that ambulances had begun transporting patients to the new hospital.

Slovenia’s first mosque opened in the capital Ljubljana on Monday after surmounting financial hurdles and right-wing opposition 50 years after the initial request to build was made.

Opponents of the project including those who criticised its Qatari financing have repeatedly tried to halt it and pig heads and blood have also been left on the site.

Islamic community head Mufti Nedzad Grabus said the mosque’s opening was “a turning point in our lives”.

“Slovenia is the last former Yugoslav state to get a mosque making Ljubljana a capital rather than a provincial town on the edge of the world” he told a press conference.

Muslims in the predominantly Catholic Alpine country first filed a request to build a mosque in the late 1960s while Slovenia was still part of former Communist Yugoslavia.

The community finally received permission 15 years ago but ran into opposition from right-wing politicians and groups as well as financial troubles.

Construction which began in 2013 cost some 34 million euros ($39 million) out of which 28 million euros were Qatari donations according to Gabris.

Situated in a semi-industrial area of Ljubljana the mosque which can hold up to 1400 people constitutes the core of the six-building Islamic Cultural Centre.

The centre also comprises the community’s offices an education centre which includes a library a restaurant a basketball court housing for the Muslim clerisy and a 40-metre (131 feet) high minaret.

All the buildings are made from white concrete combined with steel glass and wood. A large blue textile-made dome dominates the mosque’s interior referring to heaven and reminiscent of famous mosques like Istanbul’s Blue Mosque.","1245667746_10222989648390090","yinkasalaam"

2019 – Rockefeller Big Pharma Faces $1 Billion Lawsuit for Intentionally Infecting People With Syphilis

The $1billion lawsuit was approved by US District Judge against John Hopkins University Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) and the Rockefeller Foundation & seeking damages for victims of syphilis during US govt’s experiments in Guatemala during 1940s.

Guatemalan children orphans and patients from mental hospitals and prisoners were infected with syphilis to test ability of penicillin to treat sexually transmitted diseases.

The experiments were kept secret until Dr. Susan Reverby of Wellesley College uncovered the experiments in 2010 forcing President Obama to apologize.

Johns Hopkins expressed “profound sympathy for individuals and families impacted by the deplorable 1940s syphilis study funded and conducted by the U.S. government in Guatemala. We respect the legal process and we will continue to vigorously defend the lawsuit.”

“The world today has 6.8 billion people. That’s headed up to about 9 billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines health care reproductive health services we lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.” Said Gates to invitation only guests in California.

Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is a founding member of the GAVI Alliance (Global Alliance for Vaccinations and Immunization) in partnership with the World Bank WHO and the vaccine industry. The goal of GAVI is to vaccinate every newborn child in the developing world. The vaccines are accused of making people sicker and susceptible to disease and premature death.

Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation along with David Rockefeller’s Rockefeller Foundation are the creators of the GMO biotechnology & finance a project called The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) headed by former UN chief Kofi Annan. Monsanto DuPont Dow Syngenta and other major GMO agribusiness giants are reported at the heart of AGRA using it as a back-door to spread their patented GMO seeds across Africa under the deceptive label ‘bio-technology’ Gates and Buffett are major funders of global population reduction programs as is Turner whose UN Foundation was created to funnel $1 billion of his tax-free stock option earnings in AOL-Time-Warner into various birth reduction programs in the developing world.

Chemtrails & HAARP

Amy Worthington claims US is suffering from dangerous aerosol and electromagnetic operations conducted by the U.S. government under the guise of national security. Both the Pentagon’s aerosol operations and its limited nuclear wars are deeply interconnected. The military’s aerosol operations have been climate altering to the extreme. Pentagon has been involved for decades in the drastic manipulation of weather climate and atmospheric conditions. The U.S. used a chemical agent dubbed Olive Oil during Operation Popeye to induce heavy rains in Vietnam 40 years ago. HAARP is not only capable of destabilizing agricultural and ecological systems anywhere on the planet but its effects can target select regions to affect human physical mental and emotional responses during non-lethal warfare projects

It is appropriate that if a political issue needs resolving to put aside contentions held by some a process is there to allow the clearing of the air. That process has been followed and the issue is finalised.
 
Our Nation does not have a president nor are we cursed with a tyrant. We have a free media transparency in government and as recent events have shown problems don’t happen with such things as sports grants that you will not later hear of in the public forum.
 
One of the conditions of this freedom in our nation is the capacity for members of parliament to challenge their political office holders if so desired in the party room. For the Nationals this process was made as brief as possible prior to the first sitting of Parliament for the year. There was a spill of positions I stood and I lost. I respect and support the vote of the room and will strive for the re-election of a Morrison McCormack Government.
 
Now my first attentions go back to where they were before this week the New England drought fires and now the threat of Coronavirus. We arrive now at the period two years prior to the next election. This period is vital in setting the agenda that the Australian people will make their judgement on as to whether we remain with the reigns of the nation in two years’ time after the next election. There is difficulty in standing behind a promise it is so much easier to stand beside delivery if you want to get re-elected.
 
I have disdain when the term “learnings” is used. Leaning is a verb knowledge is a noun and “learnings” is nonsense. The knowledge we have attained from the bushfires and drought has to further develop our policy of building resilience into the future. 

As a government we have to deliver on what we have learnt from these natural disasters and be standing beside them by the time of the next election. 

For fires better access to reliable water supplies to fight fires clearing of road corridors to get access in and out safely to the fire grounds communication facilities that can stand the challenge of fires hazard reduction and upgrade of fire trails. This is to name but a few.
 
If you want a macro climate policy to show the world our leadership on reducing carbon emissions then we must bring in nuclear power and development of the most efficient coal power technology that uses the least units of coal for the greatest output of power. Wanting to develop the most efficient coal fired power technology in the world is not disavowing the realities of climate change it is actually something that could be provided to substantially curtail emissions.
 
We have to recognise that the public acceptance of wind towers on the hill in front of their veranda is gone and the public dissonance on that issue is as strong as any other environmental subject. We have to understand that there is no sure thing in a political debate.   If zero emissions are the goal then surely nuclear energy should be supported but it is not. If wind towers are a moral good and environmentally inoffensive why can’t we have them just off the beach at Bondi so we can feel good about ourselves while going for a surf?  It would cause a riot. Do you want a 3000 hectare solar farm next door to you? Lots of glass and aluminium neatly in rows pointing at the sun. I am not sure others will want to buy that view off you when you go to sell your house!  
 
The weather has determined the political climate and everyone is manipulating the recent calamitous events to push their own particular barrow.  Whether there is unanimity of people’s political views on the fire ground or feeding stock in drought as to what we can do to change the weather is as unlikely as to unanimity to their favourite song. When politicians do stand behind a global climate policy the only certainty is that it will be the policy that has the least direct effect on them. Wind farms are for your backyard not mine zero emission nuclear is for France only support banning coal mines if the coal mines aren’t in your electorate and try not to get caught on a sticky question of what replaces our nation’s largest export. There is a desire for intermittent power generation such as solar but an inability to afford the pump hydro to make it dispatchable. Simple answers are generally wrong.    
 
So 2020 has started with quite some colour politically and tragedy nationally. The art form of politics will be the cogent response that the parliament can show the Australian people in two years time.","239016346223324_1843125655812377","BarnabyJoyceMP"

How To Wear A Surgical Mask : The Hoax & The Truth!

A 3-ply surgical mask has three layers :

an outer hydrophobic layer which repels water blood and body fluids
a middle filter layer that is designed to filter bacteria and
an inner hydrophilic layer which absorbs water sweat and spit
3-ply surgical mask layers

In a 2-ply face mask both layers are usually made from the same material – fabric or polypropylene or other kinds of non-woven material. There is NO FILTER layer

If the mask you are using has no colour then it is NOT a 3-ply surgical mask – just a simple 2-ply face mask that is meant to maintain hygiene in a clean room or kitchen.

Posted by Dr. Adrian Wong Date: January 27 2020in: Health & Medicine Hoaxes & Scams Lifestyle(3) Comments
People are sharing tips on how to correctly wear a surgical mask. Unfortunately most of such advice are wrong.

In this article we will debunk a recent example (falsely) teaching people that there are two ways to wear a surgical mask and teach you THE ONLY CORRECT WAY to wear a surgical mask.

 

Are There Two Ways To Wear A Surgical Mask?
This hoax claiming that there are TWO WAYS to wear a surgical mask has been spreading across the Internet on blogs Facebook and of course WhatsApp.

Here is the hoax about how even doctors do not know how to properly wear a surgical  medical mask… grammatical mistakes and all.

While at the doctors office today we were informed by a Nurse the proper way to use a medical mask.How To Wear A Surgical Mask - The Hoax & The Truth!

I didn’t know about this before. I thought it would be helpful to share Because I was using them wrong the entire time.

When using a medical mask you’re suppose to use as follows:

Colored side out if you’re sick and do not want to spread your germs around.

White side out (this is the filter part) for when you’re not sick and you want to stop germs from getting in.

I always just assumed the color (blue) side went outward.

The Nurse said the entire doctors office never knew either until the supplier sent them “proper directions” for them this past week!

Hope this helps!

Well NO it does not help. In fact this hoax will probably result in a lot of people stupidly wearing their surgical masks the wrong way…

No There Is Only ONE WAY To Wear A Surgical Mask
Surgical masks are coloured on ONE SIDE to make it easy for medical staff to figure out which side FACES OUT.

Whether they are coloured blue green or pink the COLOURED SIDE is meant to face OUTWARDS.

How To Wear A Surgical Mask - The Hoax & The Truth!

If the mask you are using has no colour then it is NOT a 3-ply surgical mask – just a simple 2-ply face mask that is meant to maintain hygiene in a clean room or kitchen.

The Filter Is Always The Middle Layer
The hoax falsely claims that the white layer is the filter.

A 3-ply surgical mask has three layers :

an outer hydrophobic layer which repels water blood and body fluids
a middle filter layer that is designed to filter bacteria and
an inner hydrophilic layer which absorbs water sweat and spit
3-ply surgical mask layers

In a 2-ply face mask both layers are usually made from the same material – fabric or polypropylene or other kinds of non-woven material. There is NO FILTER layer.

Why It’s Important To Wear A Surgical Mask Correctly
The middle filter works no matter which way you wear the surgical mask so the hoax is complete hogwash.

However wearing it the wrong way will reduce your comfort as you will be exhaling into the outer hydrophobic (water-repelling) layer instead of the inner absorbent layer.

Those working with actual patients will want to wear it correctly too because the outer water-repelling layer will help prevent blood and other bodily fluids from soaking through to the filter.

How To Wear A Surgical Mask Correctly
Here are some step-by-step instructions for wearing a surgical mask correctly :

While vaccines and treatments for the new coronavirus will take several months to develop rapid diagnosis — and understanding the limitations of tests currently available — is the key to slowing the coronavirus epidemic in the immediate future public health experts say. “Testing is crucial. It’s pretty much all we have at the moment” said Paul Hunter professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia. “We need to identify possible cases and find out whether or not they have the virus. If they do they must be looked after in a way that will not infect other people and their contacts must be traced.” Testing today depends on a lab procedure called polymerase chain reaction. PCR identifies the virus by amplifying any of its genes present in a patient sample such as a throat swab. The required genetic data was published by Chinese scientists in mid-January. Although PCR has been used for decades to diagnose diseases it is relatively slow — taking several hours to prepare and test samples — and it requires specialist equipment and trained lab staff. Several companies including Novacyt Qiagen and Roche are developing faster and more portable tests designed specifically to identify the new nCoV virus but these will take time to deploy. The Chinese authorities in Wuhan at the centre of the epidemic face a daunting task in distinguishing cases of the new virus among tens of thousands of people suffering from respiratory conditions that may prove to be flu or other infections with similar symptoms. “There is certainly a challenge there in ramping up testing in such a short time and trying to get new methodology into the lab while retraining the workforce and facing restrictions on goods coming in from outside China” said Adrian Moody global development lead for infectious diseases at Qiagen. In industrialised countries outside China where there have been relatively few coronavirus cases molecular biology labs are not swamped with samples but are still being judicious about the testing work they take on. In the UK Public Health England decided not to test 93 people who were evacuated from Wuhan and are currently quarantined at Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral unless they showed symptoms of disease. Health officials said a test in such circumstances risked giving a false negative result where someone not displaying symptoms was in fact infected but did not carry enough virus to trigger a positive finding so giving misleading reassurance. The UK approach is to test people immediately if they show signs of disease. They would then be moved quickly to a tropical and infectious diseases unit such as the one at Royal Liverpool University Hospital. Independent experts agreed that this was a sensible approach. Nathalie MacDermott clinical lecturer at King’s College London said: “If you do not have symptoms you may not have enough virus in your throat to show up in a PCR test.” She said that during the 2014-15 west African Ebola epidemic some infected people in Sierra Leone were given negative results following PCR tests and then following this false reassurance they went out and unwittingly spread the virus in their community.","1048859268_10219016721862849","leon.gettler"

Shares of Gilead Sciences Inc. rallied in afternoon trading on Monday over investor excitement about a Coronavirus treatment candidate.

Gilead had said Jan. 31 that it is working with Chinese authorities to test its investigational antiviral remdesivir as a treatment for Coronavirus infections.

There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for the novel virus which was first identified in December in Wuhan China. Since then at least 361 people have died and 17205 have been sickened.

A paper published Jan. 31 in the New England Journal of Medicine outlined a positive response to Intravenous Remdesivir recorded in a patient undergoing treatment for pneumonia stemming from a Coronavirus infection. The 35-year-old man had recently returned to Snohomish County Washington from a trip to Wuhan. He was the first U.S. citizen to be diagnosed with the novel virus.

I just go this email from our school board regarding Coronavirus 

“Thames Valley has been advised today that a Western University student living in London is confirmed to have Novel Coronavirus. Officials said the woman had limited exposure to other people since returning from China and has since been in isolation except for time spent in the hospital. The woman’s recovery was quick and she has fully recovered.”

Western said “the student took great care in terms of self-isolation and treatment and has not been on campus.”

At a news conference today Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. David Williams took time to reassure the public of the low risk to residents across the province. 

“I want to re-emphasize that the risk to Ontarians remains low” said Williams. “It is clear that we are learning more and more about the coronavirus each day and our testing procedures are evolving and getting more and more precise which is good news for everyone throughout Ontario and Canada.”

Im Falle des Coronavirus wurde die Gefahr erkannt und entsprechend gehandelt. So wurde in China der Notstand ausgerufen. Mit Folgen: Angesichts des hohen Risikos haben Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft ohne weiteres Einschränkungen im täglichen Leben und Arbeiten hingenommen – es handelt sich schliesslich um eine Notlage. Auch ausserhalb von China ist klar niemand will eine globale Epidemie. Plötzlich ist es egal ob die Notstandsmassnahmen einem Teil der Wirtschaft schaden. Denn niemand will eine Epidemie! Niemand will schuld daran sein dass Menschen sterben!?

Beim Klimanotstand fürchtet man sich dagegen bereits vor dem Wort Notstand. Obwohl sich sicherlich keine Regierung riesigen Schäden Millionen von Toten und das drastische Aussterben von Arten wünscht. Mit der Klimakrise verhält es sich aber nicht viel anders als mit einer Epidemie: Sind die Kipp-Punkte überschritten wird eine Eindämmung fast unmöglich. Deshalb brauchen wir den Klimanotstand und entsprechende Massnahmen! Dabei ist aber wichtig dass die Auswirkungen und Regeln verständlich sind und ohne Ausnahmen durchgesetzt werden.?

According to the US Food and Drug Administration an N95 mask gives a very close facial fit and is very efficient against airborne particles.

It further said that the effectiveness of these masks is significantly enhanced if you place a “seal” of vaseline around the edge of the mask.

“The only mask to provide significantly different results on the Receiver was the N95 with a Vaseline seal.”

The ‘N95’ stamp means that when subjected to careful testing the respirator blocks at least 95 percent of 0.3 microns (300 nanometre) test particles.

The coronavirus molecule is 0.125 microns (125 nanometres) by comparison.

Take an inventory of supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gowns gloves masks eye protection and N95 respirators or powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) and order items that are missing or low in stock.

We should all learn the lesson from this video Fit-test users of N95 masks for maximal effectiveness.

Those were the months in 2003(SARS-CoV) outbreak especially during March 24 to March 29 2003 when the 79 SARS patients whose overall case death rate was 24.1% came with another 400 suspected cases who lived at Amoy Gardens anxiously attended the United Christian Hospital in Hong Kong we everyday put on N95 flexiseal safety goggles during ward rounds and on call overnights after which I stayed alone in my car awaiting another shower and bath  waited till all family members left home for school and work or kept distance from being contaminated. In those months I skipped all breakfast fluid intake and all meals during the clinical duties as well as the on call shift hours in order to minimize the need of going to toilet or bathroom that required changing or removing the full protective gear and clothing. The experience is similar to the fasting from sunrise to sunset that is Far? (Arabic: ????) or far??ah (?????)(obligatory) for all adult Muslims. The predawn meal is referred to as suhur and the nightly feast that breaks the fast is called iftar practised and observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting (sawm) the annual observance of Ramadan with nil by mouth under the sun.

l did not hesitate to rebuke the statement written by Professor Lok Sang Ho ?????????20????????????????????25?????????????????????????????????????????  This virus is not airborne. as well as  There is no need to wear a mask if you are well.

You should wear a facemask when you are in the same room with other people and when you visit a healthcare provider. If you cannot wear a facemask the people who live with you should wear one while they are in the same room with you.
Droplet precautions: Use a rectangular surgical face mask for an infection that spreads by large droplets when someone coughs sneezes or talks. Infections like flu whooping cough and certain types of bacterial meningitis fall into this category. Both the person who is infected and the people caring for them should wear a face mask. It is really important that caregivers dispose of the mask after every interaction and use a new one any time they are in close confines with an infected person.
Airborne precautions: Some lung or throat infections spread when small viral or bacterial particles stay suspended in the air and are breathed in by others. 2019-CoV measles SARS chickenpox and tuberculosis are a part of this category. In these cases the infected person should wear a face mask. And all people coming into close contact should wear an N95 respirator masks with a special air filter designed to protect from tiny airborne particles. These masks fit to a person’s face and are usually rounded in shape. The outbreak at the ward 8A at the Prince of Wales Hospital of Hong Kong with the Coronavirus became airborne through the whole ward within a very long range and distance due to the utilization of humidifiers and nebulizers with aerosol-generating procedures. The high infectivity of the coronavirus with peak viral load on day 10 of illness when patients were ill overcrowding of the old medical wards with low air changeshr (ACH) and aerosol-generating procedures is the most important reason for all the outbreaks.
Masks are not new to the coronavirus outbreak. Many people wore masks during the 1918 influenza pandemic. They became the defining image of the SARS outbreak in 2003. And its reasonable to see people wearing one in an airport or while on public transportation  in schools or mass gatherings.
Masks do provide protection to people in the same room as a sick individual – like caretakers.

Its better to keep dry with low air relative humidity of around 20% or less. It takes hundreds of hours to kill only some of the Coronavirus at air tem

Matagal na ang CORONAVIRUS.
1960s pa yan na-discover.
Nakakalat yan. Lumulutang.
Kaya huwag mag panic.?
7 ang HUMAN STRAINS niyan.
3 ang DEADLY una yung SARS 2nd yung MERS at 3rd itong bago kaya NOVEL ang tawag.
NOVEL means BAGO.

Ang tinamaan sa 3 VIRUS na yan ay MATATANDA MGA BATA at yung mahina ang resistensiyameaning STRESSED kulang sa TULOG di KUMAKAIN NG MAAYOS
(puro kanin at karne walang GULAY).
Mahina ang IMMUNE SYSTEM.
Ang pinakamadaling tamaan ay yung KULANG SA NUTRITION.

Pag tinamaan ka nitong VIRUS na ito ang sapol is your RESPIRATORY SYSTEM.Kasi diyan dumadaan ang VIRUS. 7-14 days ang INCUBATION nito.
So may chance ang katawan mo if you are HEALTHY & FIT na.

LABANAN ang VIRUS.
Ang VIRUS pag nilalabanan ng katawan mo ang effect is SAME SA TRANGKASO o FLU.

Walang gamot sa VIRUS (sa ngayon)
Hindi ANTI-BIOTIC ang ginagamit.
Kasi pang BACTERIAL INFECTION lang yun.
Ang pwede nating gawin ay
AYUSIN ang HYGIENE.
Maghugas ng KAMAY lagi.
Huwag kalikutin ang MATA at ILONG at BIBIG.
Huwag pumunta sa mga CLINIC at HOSPITAL kung di naman kailangan.
Avoid CROWDED PLACES like ELEVATORS HOLDING ROOMS etc.
Pwede ka gumamit ng MASK.
(Kasi naman mga tao dito kahit may SIPON at UBO pumapasok pa?)
Next is MATULOG ng MAAGA (di pumapayat ang nag-pupuyat)
KUMAIN ng MAAYOS
mag SUPPLEMENT
mag-EXERCISE REGULARLY (exercise builds-up your IMMUNE SYSTEM). Yan ang mga kailangan whether may NOVEL CORONAVIRUS o wala.

Kaya always do a proper hygiene at ayusin ang sarili dapat laging happy and eat nutritious foods and most importantly ALWAYS PRAY?

Masuwerte din tayi sa Pilipinas dahil tropical country tayo dahil kapag nabilad ang Novel Corona Virus ng matagal sa araw ito ay mamamatay at hindi tatagal.

Kailangan nang pag iingat at pag pag aalaga sa sarili ng tama.

GOD BLESS US ALL!

Published February 4 2020

Our Correspondents

 
The police on Monday said the community policing service would be purely voluntary and the constables to be recruited would not receive any salary.

The state commissioners of police who stated this in separate interviews with The PUNCH on Monday said police commands had started meeting traditional rulers and community leaders with a view to recruiting constables for the community policing initiative.

The Federal Government had on January 23 directed the police hierarchy to commence the recruitment of special constables nationwide preparatory to the implementation of its community policing policy.

The Inspector-General of Police Mohammed Adamu in a wireless message directed state police commands to set up screening committees for the recruitment of community policing constables.

The IG ordered all state commissioners of police assistant commissioners of police and divisional police officers to liaise with traditional rulers and community leaders in their domains to screen volunteers who would be engaged after passing the screening tests.

The Federal Government plan came on the heels of the South-West states’ launching of a security outfit Operation Amotekun to address incessant killings and kidnapping in the zone.

As part of the moves to recruit community policing constables the Ekiti State Police Command on Sunday said it had sent recruitment forms to all police stations in all the local government areas of the state. According to the command applicants must be between the ages of 21 and 50.

It’s not another job opportunity – Ebonyi CP

The Commissioner for Police in Ebonyi State Sola Awotinde in an interview with one of our correspondents on Monday shed light on the community policing policy.

Aworinde said the proposed recruitment was meant for Nigerians who were already employed.

He said that it was important for Nigerians to be told the truth so that whoever wanted to be part of the scheme should be prepared to know what to expect.

The police commissioner added that people had misconstrued the recruitment order of the IG into the community policing to be another paid job opportunity.

He said “We have not been given the green light to recruit anybody. We are just at the committee level.  I mean the committee that will screen the would be special constables. No command has been given the go-ahead to commence the said recruitment. The Force Headquarters has not done that.

“It is the headquarters that would say go ahead and we will start. But no command has been given such an order. The first stage is screening and we are just setting up the screening committee.

“And please people should be told this truth and sound it clear to them it is not remuneration-based job. It is voluntary. It is just going to be like the special marshal of the Federal Road Safety Corps.

“It is for those who are gainfully employed or self-employed. There is no salary for anybody in the community policing scheme. People are misconstruing it to mean another job opportunity and I have received so many calls over this.

 
“It is not a paid job. Again it is a voluntary job. And there is nothing like recruitment of constables. Also those to be engaged must be between the age of 21 and below 50.”

Also the Police Public Relations Officer for the Ekiti State Command Sunday Abutu said that the special constables that would be recruited would not be paid.

Abutu in an interview with The PUNCH  said the special constables would work voluntarily in their communities.

 
When asked if the special constables in Ekiti State would be paid he said “It will not be different from what is applicable across the federation. For now what we know is that these people are coming voluntarily. It is going to be voluntary no monetary attachment for now.”

The Ogun  State Police Command also said it would not pay any of the recruits for the special community policing scheme.

The Police Public Relations Officer in the state Abimbola Oyeyemi disclosed this in Abeokuta while fielding questions from The PUNCH.

 
Oyeyemi said the exercise started on Monday with a meeting held between the Commissioner of Police  Kenneth Ebrimson and the executive members of the Police Community Relations Committee in the state.

When asked whether the volunteer would get remuneration or not Oyeyemi said “No there is no payment for any recruit for the scheme. It is a purely volunteer service .”

“It is community policing no money is attached to it. No

Novel Coronavirus declared global health emergency by WHO after 1st person-to-person US case reported...

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern at a news conference Thursday in Geneva.

This is only the sixth time such an emergency has been declared with past examples including the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Zika virus.

The WHO reserves the designation for extraordinary events that pose a public health risk by threatening to spread internationally.

The first case of human-to-human coronavirus transmission in the U.S. has been confirmed in a patient in Illinois the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Thursday.

The transmission occurred between a husband and wife who were in close contact with one another. The wife a woman in her 60s had traveled to Wuhan China and was diagnosed with the virus last week. The husband a Chicago resident also in his 60s and who has underlying health problems had not traveled to China. !!!

The risk to the general public in Illinois remains low state health officials stressed. They said that they do not believe the virus is spreading widely in communities and are working to ensure health care workers at the hospital where the patient is being treated are protected.

Cases of human-to-human transmission previously have been reported outside of China in Germany Japan Vietnam and Taiwan.

The best recommendations for Americans who are worried about their health is to practice proper flu season hygiene including frequent hand washing covering coughs and keeping up-to-date on new information from the CDC. The CDC does not recommend wearing a face mask to prevent coronavirus.

Our assessment remains that the immediate risk to the American public is low said Dr. Robert Redfield director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The transmission in Illinois marks the sixth case of coronavirus in the U.S.

The WHO deliberated for two days last week before deciding not to declare an emergency. Since then however patients from Germany Japan Taiwan Vietnam and the U.S. have been diagnosed with the new coronavirus without having visited China. The new coronavirus is in the same family of viruses as the common cold and SARS.

That human-to-human transmission outside of China worries us Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus director general at WHO said during a Wednesday news conference.

At last count more than 7700 people have been sickened by the novel coronavirus and 170 have died from it. More than 90% percent of those cases and every death have been in China.

According to WHO 20% of cases are considered to be severe and 2% have been fatal. Its expected that the fatality rate of the new coronavirus will decrease as more cases are reported since the sickest individuals tend to seek medical treatment first.

In the United States 165 people are under investigation for the new coronavirus. Of those individuals 68 have tested negative and six have tested positive. The remaining individuals tests are in transit or have pending results.

Twenty American airports are screening passengers for signs of sickness and distributing educational materials the signs of coronavirus to people returning from China.

Airlines around the world have suspended some routes to China -- United Delta American Airlines British Airways Air Seoul Lion Air Lufthansa Group Cathay Pacific Finnair Air Asia Air India Air Canada All Nippon Airways Asiana Airlines and Korean Air.

This week the U.S. government chartered a flight to evacuate 196 Americans from Wuhan China. Those evacuees were screened and monitored for signs of illness before and throughout their flight. After landing in California the passengers entered a voluntary three-day quarantine and will be offered testing for the virus according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

On Jan. 29 President Donald Trump announced that he was forming a coronavirus task force made up of top health transportation and national security officials. The team will coordinate efforts to respond to coronavirus and work to prevent the virus from spreading.

The spectacle would help him charge up the political base he needs to turn out in droves in 2020 with claims their 2016 votes were being stolen by political elites.”

            Give that man whatever passes for a cigar in this smokeless age.

            Any number of metaphors serves to illustrate the unintended effect that the hapless failed impeachment of Donald Trump is having on his base of support. What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger the Democrats did just that with an attack that didn’t stand a chance of felling its target.

            If you’re thinking about taking a swing at a bully at a bar be sure you can deliver a roundhouse punch that’s going to lay the bastard out flat on the floor. But if you don’t have what it takes to bring him down with the first blow sneak out to the parking lot.

            The coronavirus outbreak has me thinking about disease. There’s a medical metaphor that I like best: when fighting off an infection it’s better not to use any medication than to take a weak antibiotic and risk strengthening what ails you.

            No matter the analogy President Trump emerges from his Senate impeachment trial as a more formidable adversary than he was before. While his overall popularity remains at about 46% the number of voters who “strongly” support him just hit a three-year high indicating that he is better off than before impeachment. This should come to the surprise of no one who remembers the humiliation of Bill Clinton. Republican overreach over Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky led to the Democrat leaving office in 2000 with soaring popularity.

            Probably the biggest movement in favor of Trump has been with formerly “anti-Trump Republicans” who now see the truth of the President’s supporters’ claims that Democrats would do and say anything in order to get rid of a sitting Republican president. The ranks of Never Trumpers are shrinking throwing a wrench into the strategy of centrist candidates like Biden and Buttigieg.

            Polls in key swing states show disproportionately high disapproval for impeachment. Voters in these places tend to prefer antiestablishment candidates. Impeachment allows Trump to frame himself as the rebel getting picked on by the in-crowd Congressional Democrats.

            Impeachment — more specifically this very lame rushed pro forma impeachment — also dispirits Democratic voters who see once again that the Democratic Party only seems to wage wars it knows it can’t win. What’s the point of voting for these clowns?

            One thing is for sure: no matter what perfidy is discovered or comes to light in the future it’s going to be all but impossible to take a second stab at impeachment. Now Trump really could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get away with it. Impeaching the same President twice is all but inconceivable.

            How did this happen? Democrats made one mistake after another.

            First and foremost was the lousy choice of impeachment counts. Pressuring Ukraine to investigate the Bidens looked and felt too much like political business as usual not a breach of normality so outrageous as to justify removal from office. Shades of Rob Blagojevich former governor of Illinois.

            The Ukraine line of inquiry prompted as many questions as it tried to ask. If Trump is corrupt what about the Bidens? Why were we giving aid to Ukraine in the first place when millions of Americans are homeless or poor? Why should Americans care about Ukraine? The country certainly isn’t as Democrats alleged important to American national security.

            A slim majority thought the Ukraine call was wrong. But they didn’t care enough to impeach him over it.

            Americans did care about emoluments and the president using his office to enrich himself. They did care about his wacko temperament and erratic behavior. They did care about separating children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. Inexplicably the Democrats let the good bad stuff go.

            Democrats screwed up badly with timing. You don’t have to be James Carville to know that it’s foolish to start an impeachment trial at the beginning of a presidential election campaign. You certainly don’t do it when many of your big-name candidates are senators who can’t campaign because they are stuck in Washington. Yet that’s exactly what Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff did.

            Starting the impeachment process so late in Trump’s first term forced Democrats into a rushed pro-forma process. Because Trump Administration officials broadcasted their intention to resist congressional subpoenas and the courts might have taken months to compel them to testify Democra

EN CHINA YA SE PRUEBA MEDICAMENTOS CONTRA EL CORONAVIRUS.
Un ensayo clínico para probar un nuevo medicamento contra la infección por coronavirus se está probando en China. Esto con el afán de encontrar resultados rápidos que proporcionen un medicamento que ayude a detener esta epidemia.

Se trata de Remdesivir un nuevo medicamento antiviral de Gilead Sciences Inc. que sirve para tratar enfermedades infecciosas como el Ébola y el SARS será probado por un equipo médico del Hospital de Amistad China-Japón con sede en Pekín para determinar la eficacia del tratamiento de la nueva cepa mortal de coronavirus dijo a Bloomberg News el lunes una portavoz del hospital.

La prueba para el medicamento se llevará a cabo en Wuhan la ciudad de China central y zona cero del brote viral que ha provocado la muerte hasta el momento de más de 360 personas y contagiado a más de 17.000 en China además de haberse propagado a más de doce países.

Hasta 270 pacientes con neumonía leve y moderada causada por el virus serán designados para un estudio aleatorizado doble ciego y controlado con placebo según informó el medio de noticias chino The Paper el domingo.

Farmacéuticas como GlaxoSmithKline Plc así como las autoridades chinas están intentando desarrollar vacunas y terapias para combatir el nuevo virus que es más contagioso que el SARS y podría costar a la economía global cuatro veces más que los US$40.000 millones del brote SARS de 2003. La decisión de realizar ensayos en humanos para remdesivir muestra que es una de las terapias más prometedoras contra el virus que hasta ahora no tiene tratamientos o vacunas específicos.

El fármaco experimental aún no ha sido aprobado para su uso por ningún regulador de medicamentos del mundo pero se está utilizando en pacientes afectados por el nuevo virus en ausencia de opciones de tratamiento aprobadas dijo Gilead en un comunicado la semana pasada.

El regulador de salud de China también ha recomendado el medicamento contra el VIH de AbbVie Inc Kaletra como un medicamento antiviral ad-hoc para el coronovirus. Kaletra también se someterá a pruebas en humanos según The Paper. Entretanto continúa una búsqueda global de terapias para contener la infección que puede propagarse sin ser detectada.

Johnson & Johnson ha iniciado trabajos en una vacuna preventiva contra el coronavirus y tiene “docenas de científicos” trabajando en ella dijo su director científico Paul Stoffels el mes pasado. GlaxoSmithKline y Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations dijeron el lunes que trabajarán para acelerar la creación de una vacuna y luego proporcionar las dosis rápidamente.

La neumonía del primer paciente en Estados Unidos infectado con el virus un hombre de 35 años ha mejorado después de recibir remdesivir dijeron los médicos que lo trataron en un estudio publicado en el New England Journal of Medicine la semana pasada.

La prueba en China podría resultar en una aprobación rápida de remdesivir por el regulador de medicamentos chinos que en algunos casos ha sido la más rápida del mundo. La ley de medicamentos de China ahora permite la aprobación condicional de medicamentos con datos clínicos que demuestran la eficacia contra enfermedades que son potencialmente mortales y no tienen terapias existentes.

Internet people say The Japanese government is too rotten! On January 29 Japanese men in their 50s men in their 40s and women in their 50s who returned from Wuhan China on a charter aircraft tested positive for a new coronavirus from a total of three people. In addition news of new infected persons is being broadcast on TV from returnees without symptoms.

Part 1. Among them men in their 50s had a sore throat and runny nose after returning home 
developed fever after hospitalization and tested positive.
The remaining men in their forties and women 
in their fifties did not have any noticeable symptoms after returning to Japan
 but when they were tested just in case a positive reaction to the new coronavirus was found.
 
The action history of these three people is under confirmation.
https:www.youtube.comwatch?v=pGwtJAXhQNk

Dont you think there is no point in testing because you are infected during the hidden period?
It is better for returnees and citizens to isolate rather than “stand by at home”.
Is there evidence that these people are not infected?
How many hours after the infection do you get a positive test result?
Shouldnt the Japanese government responsibly isolate for the 14 days of the incubation period?

Now it is broadcast on TV that returnees without symptoms were infected.

The Japanese government said when a person became infected in China.
1) If you dont go to Wuhan you wont get infected.
2) It does not spread from person to person.

But now in Japan viruses are transmitting from person to person.

It will continue tomorrow.

`` Revised on November 4 2019 
I am not only me but also Chinese and Philippine
Fighting for many victims of the world.
It has been nearly 10 years since the incident. My life is limited.
If the world ignores rule under the law it is natural to solve it by terrorism.

1. Foreigners engaged in illegal work other than status of residence. But foreigners are not guilty.
Only foreigners were punished under Article 70 of the Immigration Control Law Illegal labor crimes.
The Immigration Control Law on the other hand 
punishes employees who are causal for illegal work under Article 73-2 of the Immigration Control Act
 (crime for promoting illegal employment).
However Japanese justice has punished only foreigners but not employees.
This clearly violates Article 14 of the Japanese Constitution the principle of equality under the law.
And it violates international law that prohibits consciously punishing only foreigners.
If an employer who hired a foreigner illegally is innocent 
a foreigner who has been illegally worked is also innocent. .

2. The prosecutor applied Article 70 and Article 62 
of the Penal Code crimes to support other offenses to Article 70 of the Immigration Law 
on the grounds of Support of Article 22-4-4 of the Immigration Control Law Wrong with the law. 
“Article 22-4-4 of the Immigration Control Law” is the disposal of a person 
who has obtained a status of residence by making a false application.
:::::
In the past the Immigration Control Law did not punish anyone who obtained a status 
of residence through a false application (former Articles 70 and 74-6).
The Amended Immigration Control Act was enacted in the 192nd Extraordinary Diet
which stipulated penalties for those who obtained status of residence due to false applications 
their employers who assisted them their workplaces lawyers administrative scriveners and school staff.
It has been enforced since January 1 2017.
:::::
I KinGungaku a diplomat in the Philippines a Philippine embassy official is 100% innocent.

A lot of people are forwarding messages from scholars (or others) who are claiming that the coronavirus spreading in the city of Wuhan is a Divine Punishment upon the Chinese people for what is happening to the Uighurs.

This type of categorical declaration is not only unbefitting from a theological perspective it is also unbecoming from a humanitarian perspective. 

No one amongst us is qualified to speak on behalf of Allah. We are not in a position to declare why something is happening or to link a general tragedy to a specific evil. And we are not demonstrating mercy when we claim all the people being subjugated to this are being punished for a crime most of them have nothing to do with. Imagine if (may Allah protect all of us!) something happened in your city and to your family and others said this was because of something your government did!

Rather we say as the Prophet (salla Allah alayhi wa sallam) said when our mother Aisha (ra) asked him about plagues: This is a punishment that Allah sends upon whoever He wishes but Allah has also made it a mercy for the believer. So whoever is afflicted with a plague in his town and he remains in it patient expecting Allah to reward him knowing that nothing shall happen to him except what Allah has decreed shall be rewarded the rewards of a martyr! al-Bukhari.

So we learn that yes every single disaster personal or communal can be a result of sins and has the potential to be a punishment but we dont link it to any one sin or crime. And we also give hope to those who are in such places: turn to Allah seek His help be patient and know that nothing happens except with the Decree of Allah. We do not cause them to feel bad or claim they are all being punished or - God forbid - gloat over their tragedy as some seem to be doing.

Every single disaster personal or national has the potential to be a punishment or a means of mercy. It is how we respond that dictates which of the two it falls into. 

And Allah knows best.

Note: Its actually sad that I need to make this disclaimer but some people always read in the worst: my support for the Uighurs has been loud and vocal and I have given khutbahs raised awareness and made qunut for them. Of course we are enraged by what the government is doing but we do not gloat over any communal disaster as a response to our anger.","19667888299_10157501240198300","yasir.qadhi"

China’s coronavirus crisis worsened Thursday as the death toll soared to 563 and the plight of thousands trapped on quarantined cruise ships deepened global panic over the epidemic.

More than 28000 people have been infected in China where authorities are struggling to contain the outbreak despite ordering millions indoors in a growing number of cities.

Two dozen countries have confirmed cases of the respiratory disease which emerged from a market selling exotic animals in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.

Thousands of holidaymakers on cruise ships in Hong Kong and Japan face an agonising wait to find out if more among them have been infected.

At least 20 people on the Diamond Princess — off Yokohama since Monday — have tested positive. Some 3700 passengers and crew from more than 50 countries have been confined to quarters.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said another cruise ship the Westerdam was heading to the country with one confirmed case.

He said no foreigners from the vessel capable of carrying nearly 3000 passengers and crew would be allowed to disembark.

In Hong Kong 3600 people were spending a second night confined aboard the World Dream. Authorities conducted health checks after eight former passengers tested positive for the virus.

Health officials said they were asking about 5000 Hong Kongers who had taken trips on the ship since mid-January to contact them.

Hong Kong has been particularly nervous because the crisis revived memories of another coronavirus that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). It killed nearly 300 people in the city and another 349 on the Chinese mainland in 2002-2003.

Panic buying in semi-autonomous Hong Kong left supermarkets empty of toilet paper following false online claims of shortages prompting authorities to appeal for calm.

One person has died after contracting the virus in Hong Kong.

While the death toll continues to rise in China experts have stressed that at two percent mortality 2019-nCoV is far less deadly than SARS which killed around 10 percent of the people it infected 17 years ago.

The outbreak has nevertheless been declared a global health emergency prompting several governments to warn against travel to China and ban arrivals from the country while airlines have halted flights.

Almost 200 Canadians showed up at the airport in Wuhan for its first evacuations most on a commercial airliner chartered by Ottawa officials said.

Germany’s foreign ministry said it was working to bring home several nationals who had not made it out on a flight that reached Frankfurt last Saturday.

Saudi Arabia banned citizens and resident foreigners from travelling to China while Air France-KLM extended its flight suspension by another month until March 15.

Chinese President Xi Jinping told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a call that all countries should “follow World Health Organization guidelines on travel and health in a timely manner” state news agency Xinhua reported.

After Britain advised nationals to leave China Beijing’s ambassador to London said there should not be “such a panic.”

Short of medical staff

China has enacted unprecedented measures to contain the virus which spread during the Lunar New Year holiday in late January when millions criss-crossed the country.

But deaths and new infections continue to rise especially at the epicentre in Hubei province where 18 cities housing 56 million people have been under virtual lockdown since late last month.

There is a shortage of 2250 medical personnel in Hubei deputy provincial governor Yang Yunyan said Thursday. The inability to offer health workers adequate protective gear is hindering the numbers that can be deployed on the front lines he added.

With Hubei’s capital Wuhan overwhelmed authorities were due to open a second 1600-bed field hospital.

The first hospital with 1000 beds opened earlier this week and authorities said they were converting public buildings into temporary medical facilities.

The central government has announced measures intended to ensure the supply of vital resources with tax breaks for manufacturers of medical equipment.

“We must make all-out efforts across the country to meet the need for essential medical supplies and medical professionals in Hubei province” Premier Li Keqiang said according to the official Xinhua news agency.

BGI Group a genome sequencing company in southern China said it had opened a lab in Wuhan able to test 10000 people a day.

‘Don’t go out’

More cities are ordering people to stay indoors.

They include Hangzhou 175 kilometres (110 miles) from Shanghai where fences block streets and loudspeakers tell people: “Don’t go out!”

In Beijing — where streets remain eerily quiet — restaurants have been barred from accepting reservations for pa

Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go said on Thursday February 6 that he is coordinating with concerned government agencies to hasten the repatriation of Filipinos in Wuhan City and other parts of Hubei province in China who have expressed desire to return home amid the ongoing 2019 Novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease (2019-nCoV ARD) outbreak in China.

In an interview during his visit to fire victims in Quezon City Go said that the overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) may be repatriated “anytime soon”. He also expressed his concern for the Filipinos who are currently in Wuhan the ground zero of the global health emergency.

“They will come (home) soon. Anytime in the next few days kaya inihahanda na po ang possible quarantine areas” Go said urging officials to expedite the repatriation process.

“Dapat sa lalong madaling panahon while observing our health protocols. Kung pumayag na ang bansang China ready na po pauwiin na po (agad). Kawawa din sila roon. Hindi nababayaran ang lungkot at pangamba sa ibang bansa” he added.

The senator who is also the Chair of the Senate Committee on Health shared that the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) President and Presidential Adviser for Flagship Programs Vince Dizon is in coordination with the Department of Health (DOH) in preparing the Athletes’ Village in New Clark City in Tarlac as a quarantine area for repatriated Filipinos.

“Na-offer po ito ni Vince Dizon ng BCDA na ready po at mas kumpleto ang pasilidad sa Athletes’ Village. Ready to accommodate po sila (ng mga Pilipino na) coming from China” Go said.

“Kung saan komportable (at ligtas) ang mga Pilipino ‘yun ang preference ng Pangulo” he added.

Go also said that New Clark City would be a strategic site for the quarantine protocol because its location is near the Clark International Airport.

“‘Yung Clark din po malapit sa airport. Kung sakali pwede silang i-diretso roon at makababawas pa sa pangamba ng mga Pilipino” he said.

According to the  Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging and Re-Emerging Infectious Diseases there are 45 Filipinos so far that will be repatriated from Wuhan City. They are currently finalizing the documents needed with the help of foreign affairs officials and Chinese authorities in order to be allowed by the Chinese government to be repatriated back to the Philippines. Once granted permission by the Chinese authorities to exit China the repatriation is tentatively scheduled on February 8 and the repatriates are expected to arrive in the Philippines the next day according to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA).

Moreover the government will be assigning officers to help in the repatriation including doctors and nurses from DOH. Personal protective equipment shall be provided to the team.

The IATF clarified further that the repatriates must have Public Health Clearance as well as Customs Immigration and Quarantine clearance from China. Briefing and counseling for the repatriates will be conducted by the Philippine embassy.

A chartered commercial plane shall be used to fly the repatriates back to the Philippines. Before boarding thermal scanning and assessment shall be conducted again by the DOH team. While on-board the plane to the Philippines DOH shall conduct orientation on quarantine rules and procedures. Upon arrival in the Clark International Airport thermal scanning shall again be conducted prior to disembarkation.

From Clark International Airport the repatriates shall be transported to the Athletes’ Village. Pre-arranged rooms will be assigned to all OFWs packed food will be served by DOH Regional Office and routine nursing care will be available for their healthcare needs. If there are repatriates with developing cases they will be brought to the nearest referral hospital. Five DOH hospitals in Region 3 shall deploy medical teams for the whole duration of the repatriates’ stay in NCC. The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) will be in charge of the send-off after fourteen days of quarantine.

Go reiterated his advice to Filipinos to remain calm and help the government in protecting the country and its people from this global health concern.

“‘Wag na po kayong magpanic. Magtulungan na lang tayo. Sa mga nag-spread ng fake news trolls at mga bashers dapat kayo ang i-quarantine” he said.

Go aids fire victims in QC

Meanwhile Go extended help to around 60 families affected by a fire that started on February 4 at Astor Street Barangay North Fairview Quezon City.

Aside from relief and financial assistance Go also offered to provide for the uniforms and school supplies of the affected students. He also extended help to those who need to undergo medical operations.

by Anna von Reitz

This virus was specially engineered to take out colored people—Chinese Koreans Africans Indians—by the Nazi “Pure Blood” Eugenists—the same ones who are pushing the whole depopulation agenda. It is especially aimed at Asian and African males and works by shutting down their cellular energy transfer system similar to shutting off the flow of electrical current in a machine. They just shut down all at once— death occurs in about sixty seconds.

I guess we can be grateful that it is relatively quick and not painful but that is about all that can be said of it.

It was again engineered by British M16 corporations using financing from Bill Gates among others.

Those with pure white Caucasian genes have little to worry about—unless the virus mutates into a form that can more efficiently access our lung tissue.

Our friends and neighbors of color should be stocking up on coconut oil and essential oils and ultrasonic diffusers. There are numerous essential oils that kill viruses and bacteria of this kind including Oregano Oil and classic spice oils and mixtures of spice oils—clove cinnamon nutmeg allspice.

Use the diffuser to distribute a fine mist of essential oil throughout the air and breathe it in so it kills any virus on surfaces and in the lungs and nasal passages.

Mixing a few drops of essential oil with ten times the amount by volume with coconut oil as a carrier oil and swabbing it around the lips and nostrils and using it as a body oil on hands will also kill it.

Large doses of Vitamin C—up to the point where stools are getting loose—will help finish the job inside the body.

Limiting outside contact is of course advisable especially for colored people.

Wearing masks won’t help with a virus when there is no sign of any accompanying bacterial infection— which is why the CDC and WHO are not promoting the use of masks.

I hope that this unfolding nightmare is enough to wake people up to the EVIL in our midst and the extent that these madmen and madwomen will go to promote and realize their extremist ideas and prejudices.

I hope it is not lost on colored people around the world that this has been created and unleashed by a tiny tiny fraction of the so-called “elites”—just a handful of unspeakable monsters—Nazi Eugenists who were allowed to live and perpetuate their poisonous beliefs in the wake of the Second World War.

I hope that the Caucasian people of the world will use their relative immunity to serve and assist those of color and will close ranks only in their determination to eradicate once and for all time the “religion” of Babylon and the evil teachings of Nazism including prejudice against people of color and notions of “pure blood” and breeding and treating people as animals.

The Romans realized too late that their tolerance of these venal “religious” practices and adoption of these elitist ideas was like a time bomb of self-destruction—a sort of booby-trap—left behind by the defeated Carthaginians.

I pray that the governments of the West will wake up and realize that the Nazis have similarly aimed to snatch victory out of the jaws of defeat by inculcating their twisted ideas and venal “religion” into our schools and universities our governments and fraternal organizations and have spread them like the germs of a foul disease of the mind and heart to our military and scientific communities as well.

These false beliefs and evil practices must be recognized for what they are and done away with once and for all time.

All thinking men and women all feeling and sentient beings are called to stand firm against this and every other onslaught of EVIL.

“Let not your hearts be troubled neither let them be afraid….”

As this virus and the evil ideas that led to its creation are the handiwork of men we know also that we have the means to overcome this evil too. What was created by men can be destroyed by men and this Our Father in Heaven will help us to do.

As we turn from idolatry and fear and prejudice and self-interest and as we seek life and compassion with all our hearts and minds this contagion and all the other evil ideas and plots of the Evil Ones among us will be brought to nothing.

They will disappear as if they never were and fade away into the Abyss.

Re-focus your minds and hearts and think of the contagion in China in a different way—without fear and without horror.

Imagine the Coronavirus and Nipah virus self-destructing mutating into harmless versions of themselves. Tell the viruses to do this. Command them to do so.

Imagine vast waves of healing and virus-specific bio-acoustic therapies being unleashed to cleanse China and everywhere else in the world preventing any Plague.

Concentrate on the evil men and women responsible for all this death and fear and on reflecting all the destruction back to them the guilty parties specifically so that the whole

        The NHS has told hospitals they have two days to create priority assessment pods for those suspected of having coronavirus.The NHS strategic incident director for coronavirus Professor Keith Willett said in a letter to hospitals that the plans needed to be put in place to avoid a surge in emergency departments due to coronavirus.
The letter was seen by Sky News.Those suspected of having the virus will be kept isolated and apart from other patients at A&E services so that an assessment can be made about their health.

        The letter sent to hospitals on Wednesday
      
  

Patients will be given instructions about how to speak to the NHS 111 service on an allocated phone if necessary their location details will be passed to the A&E service via their red phone so that a collection can be arranged.        
Rooms will then need to be decontaminated after every patient.
Hospitals are also being warned to expect an influx of patients because of the virus.
An NHS spokesperson said: Anyone returning from Hubei province in the last 14 days should stay indoors avoid contact with other people and call NHS 111 whether or not they are showing symptoms.Anyone with a cough fever or shortness of breath who attends hospital and has recently returned from China will be advised to follow signs to NHS 111 pods and call for advice so they stay isolated from other patients and avoid causing unnecessary pressure in A&E.The updated advice to hospitals comes as British researchers tell Sky News that they have made a significant breakthrough in the race to develop a vaccine for the disease.

Professor Robin Shattock head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London said he is now at the stage to start testing the vaccine on animals as early as next week with human studies in the summer if enough funding is secured.He told Sky News: Conventional approaches usually take at least two to three years before you even get to the clinic. And weve gone from that sequence to generating a candidate in the laboratory in 14 days.

KZN health dept awaits lab tests on two suspected coronovirus cases
  
Two suspected coronavirus cases have been reported in KwaZulu-Natal although there was not yet any laboratory confirmation the provincial health department said on Thursday.

Spokesperson Noluthando Nkosi said one case was being handled by a departmental facility while the other was at a private facility in Durban.

The department is monitoring the treatment and management of these patients quite closely.

She added that this was in accordance with the extensive stringent measures and protocols that have been put in place as announced by department of health. 

Nkosi said the public would be notified should there be any new developments urging people to remain calm and avoid being misled by false statements which are peddled on social media platforms.

On Wednesday a patient in Limpopo was cleared after being held in isolation at Ellisras Hospital in Lephalale.

According to the provincial health department this had been a precautionary measure after the man developed a high fever and other symptoms consistent with a respiratory disease. 

According to Al Jazeera at least 25 countries have confirmed cases of the virus.

On Wednesday the death toll from the outbreak in mainland China rose to 563 it reported.","455468197966045_1347344325445090","Mutshinyafulo"

About the Virus

This virus was specially engineered to take out colored people— Chinese Koreans Africans Indians — by the Nazi “Pure Blood” Eugenists —the same ones who are pushing the whole depopulation agenda.  It is especially aimed at Asian and African males and works by shutting down their cellular energy transfer system similar to shutting off the flow of electrical current in a machine. They just shut down all at once — death occurs in about sixty seconds. 

I guess we can be grateful that it is relatively quick and not painful but that is about all that can be said of it. 

It was again engineered by British M16 corporations using financing from Bill Gates among others.

Those with pure white Caucasian genes have little to worry about— unless the virus mutates into a form that can more efficiently access our lung tissue.   

Our friends and neighbors of color should be stocking up on coconut oil and essential oils and ultrasonic diffusers.  There are numerous essential oils that kill virus and bacteria of this kind including Oregano Oil and classic spice oils and mixtures of spice oils— clove cinnamon nutmeg allspice. 

Use the diffuser to distribute a fine mist of essential oil throughout the air and breathe it in so it kills any virus on surfaces and in the lungs and nasal passages. 

Mixing a few drops of essential oil with ten times the amount by volume with coconut oil as a carrier oil and swabbing it around the lips and nostrils and using it as a body oil on hands will also kill it. 

Large doses of Vitamin C — up to the point where stools are getting loose — will help finish the job inside the body. 

Limiting outside contact is of course advisable especially for colored people. 

Wearing masks won’t help with a virus and there is no sign of any accompanying bacterial infection— which is why the CDC and WHO are not promoting the use of masks.  

I hope that this unfolding nightmare is enough to wake people up to the EVIL in our midst and the extent that these madmen and madwomen will go to promote and realize their extremist ideas and prejudices.  

I hope it is not lost on colored people around the world that this has been created and unleashed by a tiny tiny fraction of the so-called “elites”— just a handful of unspeakable monsters — Nazi Eugenists who were allowed to live and perpetrate their poisonous beliefs in the wake of the Second World War. 

I hope that the Caucasian people of the world will use their relative immunity to serve and assist those of color and will close ranks only in their determination to eradicate once and for all time the “religion” of Babylon and the evil teachings of Nazism including prejudice against people of color and notions of “pure blood” and breeding and treating people as animals. 

The Romans realized too late that their tolerance of these venal “religious” practices and adoption of these elitist ideas was like a time bomb of self-destruction — a sort of booby-trap — left behind by the defeated Carthaginians. 

I pray that the governments of the West will wake up and realize that the Nazis have similarly aimed to snatch victory out of the jaws of defeat by inculcating their twisted ideas and venal “religion” into our schools and universities our governments and fraternal organizations and have spread them like the germs of a foul disease of the mind and heart to our military and scientific communities as well. 

These false beliefs and evil practices must be recognized for what they are and done away with once and for all time. 

All thinking men and women all feeling and sentient beings are called to stand firm against this and every other onslaught of EVIL.  

“Let not your hearts be troubled neither let them be afraid....” 

As this virus and the evil ideas that led to its creation are the handiwork of men we know also that we have the means to overcome this evil too.  What was created by men can be destroyed by men and this Our Father in Heaven will help us to do. 

As we turn from idolatry and fear and prejudice and self-interest and as we seek life and compassion with all our hearts and minds this contagion and all the other evil ideas and plots of the Evil Ones among us will be brought to nothing. 

They will disappear as if they never were and fade away into the Abyss. 

Re-focus your minds and hearts and think of the contagion in China in a different way— without fear and without horror.  

Imagine the Coronavirus and Nipah virus self-destructing mutating into harmless versions of themselves.  Tell the viruses to do this. Command them to do so. 

Imagine vast waves of healing and virus-specific bio-acoustic therapies being unleashed to cleanse China and everywhere else in the world preventing any Plague.

Concentrate on the evil men and women responsible for all this death and fear and on reflecting all the destruction back

Khazarian mob using virus fear porn in desperate attempt to keep control over its 200-plus “nation states”
Benjamin Fulford

The Khazarian mob is fighting for its life and stoking pandemic fear porn in a desperate attempt to keep its control grid over humanity multiple sources say.  This is happening because they cannot meet a payments deadline (temporarily extended into February) for the United States of America Corporation the sources involved in the negotiations say.  One of the aims of the negotiations is to restore sovereignty to the people and the Republic of the United States of America.  This will also result in the unveiling of the secret space program they add.

We will talk more about this later but first let us look at the cabal’s pandemic survival gambit.  As most of our readers are probably already aware it is highly unlikely the “Coronavirus” outbreak in China was a naturally occurring event.  There are many signs this pandemic was planned in advance in an attempt to extort money from China for the U.S. Corporation.

First of all there was a systematic attack on all Internet sites that provide news suppressed by the corporate propaganda media.  For example Natural News with its long history of exposing vaccine-related scandals was shut down.  Jimstone Freelance was also hit harder than usual.  Other journalists are being hit with bogus criminal charges.
https:www.zerohedge.comgeopoliticalempires-war-oppositional-journalism-continues-escalate

This site too has come under severe attack.  Our former webmaster suddenly lost his mind and displayed signs of severe PCP poisoning.  Now he has “committed suicide.”  Following this we were locked out of our own site until white hats in the NSA helped restore it.  We are also under serious financial attack.

These attacks came just before the coronavirus pandemic emerged and was given sensational fear-mongering and saturation coverage in the corporate media.  In addition to being blackmail this appears to be an attempt to reinsert fear and hate as the controlling narrative of our public discourse.

It looks like they had a rehearsal on October 18 2019 when a huge exercise was held in the U.S. simulating a pandemic and the resulting economic collapse.  The sponsors of this event were the World Economic Forum (Davos) the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Bloomberg School of Public Health at John Hopkins University.  In other words Cabal Central.  Then just as the World Economic Forum was having its annual meeting in Davos on January 21-24 2020 a real pandemic broke out and was given saturation publicity.

However this plot if it is one is blowing up in their faces because alternative news sites like Prepare for Change put out some of the massive evidence that exists showing that the U.S. Corporate government has been manufacturing and spreading bio-weapons ever since George Bush Jr. stole the election in 2000.  Remember these are the guys who said an ethnic-specific bio-weapon would be a “useful political tool.”
https:en.wikipedia.orgwikiEthnic_bioweapon

Here for example is a U.S. government patent on coronaviruses:
https:prepareforchange.net20200124c-i-a-patent-us7220852b1-coronavirus-aka-sars

British intelligence are reporting to us that they are hearing it is a “pneumonia virus which arose out of a poorly managed bio-site.”

The allegations against her include that she lied on her visa form to hide the fact that she is a Chinese military officer. The feds reviewed her electronic devices and found that she had done research on U.S. military projects and was compiling information on two U.S. scientists who specialized in robotics and computer science.

The bigger picture - these cases involve nanotechnology robotics chemistry biomedical research. The U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts Andrew Lelling said that this is not an accident or coincidence!!

AI Predicts Coronavirus Could Infect 2.5 Billion And Kill 53 Million. Doctors Say “That’s Not Credible”

An AI-powered simulation run by a technology executive says that Coronavirus could infect as many as 2.5 billion people within 45 days and kill as many as 52.9 million of them. Fortunately however conditions of infection and detection are changing which in turn changes incredibly important factors that the AI isn’t aware of.

And that probably means we’re safer than we think.Probably being the operative word. Rational or not fear of Coronavirus has spread around the world.

Facebook friends in Nevada are buying gas masks. Surgical-quality masks are selling out in Vancouver Canada where many Chinese have recently immigrated. United and other airlines have canceled flights to China and a cruise ship with thousands of passengers is quarantined off the coast of Italy after medical professionals discovered one infected passenger.

A new site that tracks Coronavirus infections globally says we are currently at 24566 infected 493 dead and 916 recovered.

All this prompted James Ross co-founder of fintech startup HedgeChatter to build a model for estimating the total global reach of Coronavirus.

I started with day over day growth” he told us using publicly available data released by China. “I then took that data and dumped it into an AI neural net using a RNN recurrent neural network model and ran the simulation ten million times. That output dictated the forecast for the following day. Once the following day’s output was published I grabbed that data added it to the training data and re-ran ten million times.”

The result so far have successfully predicted the following day’s publicly-released numbers within 3% Ross says.
The results were shocking. Horrific even.

Coronavirus predictions via a neural net assuming conditions dont change. Note: doctors say conditions will change and are changing. Coronavirus predictions via a neural net assuming  From 50000 infections and 1000 deaths after a week to 208000 infections and almost 4400 deaths after two weeks the numbers keep growing as each infected person infects others in turn. In 30 days the model says two million could die. And in just 15 more days the death toll skyrockets.

But there is good news: The model doesn’t know every factor which Ross knows.

And multiple doctors and medical professionals says the good news is that the conditions and data fed into the neural network are changing. As those conditions change the results will change massively.

One important change: the mortality rate.

“If a high proportion of infected persons are asymptomatic or develop only mild symptoms these patients may not be reported and the actual number of persons infected in China may be much higher than reported” says Professor Eyal Leshem at Sheba Medical Center in Israel. “This may also mean that the mortality rate (currently estimated at 2% of infected persons) may be much lower.”

Wider infection doesn’t sound like good news but if it means that the death rate is only .5% or even .1% ... Coronavirus is all of a sudden a much less significant problem.

Also now that the alarm has gone out behavior changes. And that changes the spread of the disease.

“Effective containment of this outbreak in China and prevention of spread to other countries is expected to result in a much lower number infected and deaths than estimated” Leshem says.

Dr. Amesh A. Adalja a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security agrees.

“The death rate is falling as we understand that the majority of cases are not severe and once testing is done on larger groups of the population — not just hospitalized patients — we will see that the breadth of illness argues against this being a severe pandemic.”

That’s one of the key factors: who are medical doctors seeing? What data are we not getting?

“The reported death rate early in an outbreak is usually inflated because we investigate the sickest people first and many of them die giving a skewed picture” says Brian Labus an assistant professor at the UNLV school of public health. “The projections seem unrealistically high. Flu infected about 8% of the population over 7-8 months last year this model has one-third of Earth’s population being infected in 6 weeks.”

All these factors combined create potentially large changes in both the rate of infection and mortality and even small changes have huge impacts on computer forecasts

Australian universities are currently scrambling the needs of a large number of Chinese students impacted by the Federal Governments travel ban.

There are more then 150000 Chinese students at our universities.

The third biggest industry in NSW is foreign students- worth $39 billion a year.

30 per cent of university income is Chinese enrolment. 

Phil Honeywood is the chair of the global task force set up to coordinate the university sectors response to the coronavirus.

He says up until now our universities have been actively recruiting students from Wuhan the epicentre of the outbreak!

In Melbourne Monash University will delay the start of first semester classes for one week as the coronavirus outbreak restricts the ability of students and staff to make classes.

The university announced on Friday that orientation week activities would also be postponed.

UNSW with 15000 Chinese students starts classes in two weeks and has told students it will consider requests to study online from those affected by the crisis.

Most universities including UNSW and Monash are asking students to self-quarantine only if they have been in China’s Hubei province (the centre of the outbreak) within the past 14 days. 

In my view- we rely far too much on Chinese and foreign students.

Its all about the dollar signs.","103528053573479_565439727382307","alanjonesaustralia"

DID A CARTOON REALLY PREDICT AND FORESHADOW THIS?!!

On Sunday Jan. 26th 2020 it was reported that 41-year-old NBA basketball player Kobe Bryant was involved in a helicopter crash when the chopper hit the ground in Calabasas at 185mph. Nine victims were said to be involved including 13-year-old Gianna. Bryant was traveling to Mamba Academy in Thousand Oaks California for a basketball game where Gianna would play and Bryant was expected to coach.

But there’s more to this story than what meets the eye especially when it involves Illuminati predictive programming and messaging.

Is it a surprise or a coincidence how this event occurred on the exact same day as the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards? And how a Twitter tweet “foreshadowed” this very event just 7 years earlier on Nov. 13th 2012?

Not only that but Kobe Bryant is also depicted in a helicopter crash and explosion from the Comedy Central cartoon entitled “Legends of Chamberlain Heights.” In the episode entitled “End of Days” that aired as of Nov. 16th 2016 (111616 or “911” TWICE!!) — Here is the episode summary: “A leaked sex tape causes a global internet blackout and the Legends must find a way to survive the apocalypse. Meanwhile Milk cashes in on his pirated Chinese satellite connection which gives him access to the only internet left.”

But What Is The PLANE Truth?!

Because this cartoon not only alluded to Kobe Bryant but also an internet blackout apocalypse China and a worldwide catastrophe… And “coincidentally enough” China has been the epicenter of recent news with the reported coronavirus not to mention the Chinese New Year taking place only a few days ago as of Jan. 25th 2020 — “Year Of The RAT”….

Kanye West also ranted about a “NEW WORLD” and even mentioned “aliens” back on Nov. 19th 2016 (111916 or “911 TWICE!!)… With all of these “911” symbolisms and eerie subliminal programming could the eliteIlluminati be using this event to message and foreshadow A BIGGER Event?!

What Could Be The BIGGER Agenda To Come?!!

THE TRUTH REVEALED!!!

THE DECEPTIONS ARE REAL AND IT’S TIME TO WAKE UP TO THE WORLD AROUND YOU!!!!

NO LONGER FALL VICTIM FOR THE DECEPTIONS! PLEASE SEEK YAHUAH AND HIS TRUE SON YAHUSHA — SO THAT THE TRUTH WILL MAKE YOU FREE!!!

The WHO has said the outbreak does not yet constitute a pandemic
The number of people killed in China by the coronavirus outbreak jumped on February 5 to 490 after hardest-hit Hubei province reported 65 more people had died — the biggest single-day tally since the first fatalities emerged last month.

More than 20 countries have confirmed cases of the virus prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a global health emergency several governments to institute travel restrictions and airlines to suspend flights to and from China.
The WHO said Tuesday that the dramatic measures taken by China had provided a window of opportunity to halt transmission while calling for more global solidarity to combat the virus. The novel coronavirus has continued to spread with Singapore Malaysia and Thailand on Tuesday reporting new infections that were not imported from China.

In a sign of growing concern about a spread to other densely-populated Chinese metropolitan areas authorities in three cities in eastern Zhejiang province — including one near Shanghai — limited the number of people allowed to leave their homes.

 

Three districts in Hangzhou — including the area where the main office of Chinese tech giant Alibaba is based — now allow only one person per household to go outside every two days to buy necessities affecting some three million people. The city is only 175 kilometres southwest of the financial hub of Shanghai which has reported more than 200 cases including one death. Zhejiang has confirmed 829 cases — the highest number outside the central province of Hubei whose capital Wuhan is the epicentre of the outbreak.

The WHO has said the outbreak does not yet constitute a pandemic.

The head of the organisation Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus accused wealthy countries of falling short on their duties in sharing data stating that: Of the 176 cases reported outside China so far WHO has received complete case report forms for only 38 percent.
Hong Kongs first death
The death of the 39-year-old man in Hong Kong came as the semi-autonomous city closed all but two land crossings with the Chinese mainland.

Health officials noted that the mortality rate for the new coronavirus stood at 2.1% with most victims either old or with underlying health problems. SARS killed nearly 10% of patients.

New foreign cases
Singapore confirmed the first four cases of people being infected locally taking the total number of infections in the city-state to 24.

In another example of growing global anxiety Japan has quarantined a cruise ship carrying 3711 people and was testing those onboard for the virus after a former passenger was diagnosed with the illness in Hong Kong.

Macau Chinas semi-autonomous gambling hub that is popular with mainland Chinese visitors decided to temporarily close all of its casinos for at least two weeks.

And the UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Tuesday advised Britons to leave China if they can to minimise their risk of exposure to the virus. The United States meanwhile acknowledged that the outbreak may delay Beijings plans to purchase American goods under the terms of a deal meant to end the two countries trade war.

Beijing admits shortcomings
China made a rare admission of fallibility earlier this week acknowledging shortcomings and difficulties exposed in the response to the epidemic. The government also said it urgently needed medical equipment such as surgical masks protective suits and safety goggles as it battles the outbreak.

Most of the deaths have been in Wuhan and the rest of surrounding Hubei province which has largely been under lockdown for almost two weeks.

A 1000-bed field hospital in Wuhan built from scratch within two weeks to relieve overburdened medical facilities started receiving patients on Tuesday with a second makeshift hospital due to open later this week. A cultural building an exhibition centre and a gymnasium have also been converted into improvised clinics with 3400 beds. State media reported that the city planned to convert an additional eight facilities into hospitals.","634027740091645_VK_2885366524817285","AmericanNewsTodayUSA"

Ahad - 02022020
( 1 - 36 )

1. Seekor Kerbau
Membawa Lumpur
Habis Semuanya
Terpalit

Jangan Biarkan
Susu Sebelanga
Rosak
Akibat Setitik 
Nila

2. Entah siapakah yang mengarang kiasan atau pepatah ini namun ia maseh diguna pakai sehingga kini dan mungkin kekal sehingga cucu cicit kita

3. Tak pasti siapa kah penasihat Budak Kecil ini yang juga dikenali sebagai Si Pendek atau Si Ketot

4. Hampir setiap kenyataan yang ditujukan khusus kepada Tun Dr. Mahathir  Perdana Menteri  ia sebenarnya menampilkan lagi KEBODOHAN beliau sendiri

5. Kini beliau bertindak dan berlagak sebagai Pemangku Sultan  yang entah kemana menghilang diri bercuti  menghiburkan diri dengan wang ringgit yang bertimbun yang telah dikumpulkan  hanya sesekali timbul sedangkan rakyat Johor terpaksa kais pagi makan pagi 

6. Sekali lagi adalah diharapkan Majlis Raja - Raja  terutama Yang DiPertuan Agong dan Raja Permaisuri Agong yang kebetulan adalah merupakan Pakchik dan Makcik budak ini  dapat MENASIHATKAN beliau agar jangan terlalu celupar  BUKAN KAH PERLEMBAGAAN MENGHALANG RAJA - RAJA atau PEMANGKU MENCAMPURI POLITIK DAN PENTADBIRAN ?

7. Perlu diingatkan  menjelang Pilihanraya Umum 2018 HANYA 3 orang Sultan  Sultan Kelantan  Sultan Selangor dan Johor bersama budak ini yang telah meluahkan kebencian mereka terhadap Tun yang kini telah dipilih sebagai Perdana Menteri

8. Diantara mereka hanya Ibrahim dan anak manjanya sahaja yang maseh berterusan  mungkin kerana Kerajaan PH MEMBERHENTIKAN ekspot pasir ke Singapura dan TIDAK membenarkan pembeli - pembeli unit Forest City yang berjumlah berpuluh ribu dari China diberi status Permanent Resident dan menghantar ramai pekerja pulang ke China

9. Mereka berdua terlalu BERMAHARAJALELA semasa Negara diperintah oleh Najib dan Menteri Besar UMNO

10. Sejak menggambil alih banyak lot tanah termasuk Pulau Kukup dirampas atau dirompak dan ada yang diletakkan atas nama Tanah Sultan atau Sultanate Land dan banyak perniagaan dibolot oleh keluarga mereka

11. Syarikat - syarikat seperti Johor Corp dan anak - anak syarikatnya seperti KFC 
TERPAKSA MENDERMA berjuta ringgit setiap tahun bagi membayai pasukan bola JDT dan beberapa ahli keluarga nya

12. Lupakah kita peristiwa bagaimana seorang rakyat kita yang di tembak mati dan ada yang dipukul dengan teruk oleh bapa Ibrahim disatu ketika dahulu 

13. Apa pula kesah bagaimana Ibrahim memenjarakan bertahun lamanya Peguam Kamal Hisham Jaafar anak Johor kerana hanya tidak mahu terlibat menipu Tengku Zanariah ( Alfatihah )  Mak Tiri beliau bagi membolot harta peninggalan bapa beliau  Tengku Mahmood Iskandar yang ketika itu baru meninggal dunia

14. Rakyat juga tidak lupa bagaimana Budak Kecil Bodoh Ini dengan dibantu oleh pengawal - pengawal peribadi nya membelasah cucu Tengku Jaafar  Negri Sembilan dengan begitu dashyat sekali  begitu juga kes - kes lain yang TIDAK DI LAPURKAN

15. Sudah lah susah namun Rakyat TERPAKSA membayar cukai itu dan ini sedangkan mereka TIDAK membayar cukai seperti beratus kereta mewah yang diimport  dan minyak kapalterbang peribadi pun mungkin dibayar oleh Kerajaan Negeri

16. Itulah nasib rakyat Bangsa Johor apabila mereka mempunyai seorang PERAMPAS KUASA yang TIDAK ADA SETITIS PUN DARAH RAJA ( bermula dengan rampasan kuasa oleh keturunan mereka  Daeng Abdul Rahman )  dan pada masa yang sama pula TIDAK MEMPUNYAI PELAJARAN yang sempurna seperti kebanyakan Raja dan anak - anak mereka juga anak - anak orang kampung 

17. Mengikut kajian asal usul keturunan Kesultanan Johor modern  ia bermula dari Abu Bakar yang bukan sahaja terlalu BERBANGGA dengan panggilan Sir Albert Backer tetapi mereka berbangga mengamalkan cara hidup orang putih atau mat salih bermula dengan pakian resmi mereka sehingga kini yang TIDAK LANGSUNG mencerminkan pakian tradisi Melayu

18. Dari Albert Backer yang mempunyai kekasih berbangsa Inggeris selain dari punyai ramai isteri sehinggalah ibu kepada Ibrahim sekarang yang juga nenek Ismail adalah seorang orang putih rakyat biasa dari England

19. Rekod sejarah juga membuktikan Sultan Ibrahim  anak kepada Abu Bakar atau Sir Albert Backer MENENTANG habis - habisan usaha Tengku Abdul Rahman bagi mendapatkan Kemerdekaan dari penjajah British  beliau mahu Negara ini terus dijajah oleh British

20. Sebenar nya sudah agak lama isu Ibrahim dan anaknya Ismail tidak disentuh namun sikap BIADAP dan KEBODOHAN budak ini memaksa isu ini di ketengahkan semula

21. Tidak lama dulu rakyat Johor telah didendangkan oleh Sultan mereka dengan kenyataan kononnya Johor akan melaksanakan sistem persekolahan sendiri sedangkan Pelajaran adalah dibawah bidang kuasa dan tanggongjawab Kerajaan Pusat

The World has once again been unexpectedly hit by a mysterious disease called 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCOV) or simply coronavirus. The epidemics epicenter has been traced to Chinas Hubei Province in the City of Wuhan whose population of 11 million people have been placed under a virtual lockdown.

It is worth noting that Hubei Province is the commercial center of China and therefore a global business destination for most nations that rely on China as a trading partner. In its sitting in Geneva Switzerland on 30th January 2020 the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the virus outbreak in Wuhan a public health emergency of International Concern(PHEIC) arising from the strategic and unique standing of Hubei Province as an international business destination with an inherent potential for exportation of the epidemic to the rest of the World. 

In the same sitting WHO identified 13 top priority countries in Africa which have direct links or a high volume of travel to China and Zambia Tanzania Angola DRC and South Africa mentioned as some of those nations under that category. 

In view of the foregoing we call upon the Zambian government and all stakeholders to

1. Immediately carry out a comprehensive public health awareness campaign as a matter of urgency so that prevention message can reach everyone in the country
2. Account for all Zambians currently in China
3. Prepare adequate quarantine facilities and services and strictly monitor all ports of entry. 
4. Track everyone who has returned to Zambia from China in the last 7 days.

Since the incubation period for Coronavirus is 14 days we call upon Zambians who have been to any part of China or who has had close contact with anyone who has been to China to immediately report to any nearest health centre for further investigation whenever they feel unwell.

Prevention starts from each one of us. Please stay safe.

Eduardo Rodríguez profesor investigador de la Escuela de Ingeniería y Ciencias explicó que la reconstrucción filogenética puede ser abordada como un problema de optimización combinatoria y resolverse a través de algoritmos computacionales avanzados.

La optimización combinatoria explicó el científico es una rama de las matemáticas aplicadas que se encuentra en la intersección de varios campos incluidas las ciencias de la computación la investigación operativa y la inteligencia artificial.

El profesor del Tec campus Guadalajara explicó que este análisis es posible gracias a que las autoridades de salud en China han publicado en la base de datos GenBank el genoma del virus nCoV-2019 desde que se identificaron los primeros contagios en Wuhan China.

SAM RAINSY’S ATTEMPTED RETURN TO CAMBODIA SHOWS HUN SEN IS RUNNING OUT OF TIME

By David Whitehouse

Cambodian opposition figure Sam Rainsy told everyone that he would be back in Cambodia for independence day celebrations on November 9. He never made it and is still in exile in Paris. Game set and match to Prime Minister Hun Sen?
Some media reports at the time suggested that the failure to return could mean the end of Sam Rainsy’s political career. Other journalists have accused him of a lack of courage – though without suggesting any alternative opposition strategy.
Opinion polls are taboo in Cambodia so it’s hard to measure how the attempted return affected the popularity of Sam Rainsy. If his Facebook page is any guide the episode has not dimmed his standing in Cambodia. His recent video on Facebook in which he challenged Hun Sen to put him on trial for treason in place of Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Kem Sokha has been viewed well over a million times: bear in mind that Cambodia has a population of 15 million and that many have no Internet access.
Kem Sokha and Sam Rainsy were the joint founders of the CNRP in 2012. Sam Rainsy stood down as leader in 2017 hoping to avoid his list of convictions for various offences including libel being used as grounds to justify the dissolution of the party. So Hun Sen simply arrested Kem Sokha instead for treason dissolved the CNRP then cast aside to seek evidence for the charge. This “evidence” largely consists of an unremarkable speech made by Kem Sokha in Australia in 2013.
This is worth repeating if you are new to the story: an exiled dissident who has spent most of the last 15 years in Paris who has accumulated a stack of in absentia libel convictions in Cambodia’s courts and who demands to be put on trial for the treason charge now faced by his deputy as party leader until 2017 is not facing trial because . . . the government is too scared to do it.
There’s no reason to think that Sam Rainsy’s political career won’t continue for as long as he wants it to. If the international community on which Cambodia’s export-driven economy depends makes it clear to Hun Sen that he can’t effectively banish his rivals from the country then it will continue in Cambodia.
Chinese dependence
In the event Sam Rainsy and CNRP leaders including vice president Mu Sochua went to Malaysia and Indonesia where they were received by ministers and parliamentarians. This in itself represents a breach in the narrow ASEAN dogma of “non-interference” that comforts dictators everywhere. All possible avenues were attempted to reach Cambodia. It was simply impossible to enter the country. Hun Sen banned airlines from flying Sam Rainsy to Cambodia and mobilized tens of thousands of soldiers and police who were authorised to use all available weapons to block any arrival.
Preventive arrests of CNRP supporters were carried out and threats made against the population to deter any repeat of the mass welcome that greeted Sam Rainsy when he last returned to Cambodia from exile in July 2013. Hun Sen even made a successful request to Thailand to prevent his entry and so the possibility of entering Cambodia by land.
A direct flight from Wuhan to Cambodia might have been a better bet. After the outbreak of coronavirus Cambodia maintained direct flights from Wuhan even as other countries closed them. Direct flights from the rest of China to Cambodia are still allowed with Hun Sen openly prioritizing continued flows of investment and tourist revenue from China above the public health emergency. That dependence on China is becoming ever greater as the European Union prepares to decide on February 12 on whether to withdraw Cambodia’s access to EU markets under the Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme.
China clearly has its hands full dealing with coronavirus. The emergency is likely to mean that China’s economy will take a serious hit and client regimes that need bailing out will just have to wait. Hun Sen’s request to China to be allowed to visit Wuhan this month was politely declined. Even if staggered a withdrawal of EU free-trade rights will deal a serious blow to the Cambodian economy and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. Any responsible leader would seek to avoid it. Yet Hun Sen has made nothing in the way of substantial concessions because of an unknowable mixture of fear pride and stubbornness.
What is certain is that disregarding the democratic norms demanded by free trade partners cannot ensure a stable f

FILIPINO SCIENTIST SAYS VCO
PROTECTS PEOPLE FROM NCOV

Healing Miracles of the
Virgin Coconut Oil

By Dr. Conrado Dayrit PhD

Why is VCO being considered as a nutriceutical substance? Aside from the instant energy that it provides to the human body it also have some medicinal properties. It was found out that the medium chain (C 8 – C12) fats in coconut oil is similar to the fats in mother’s milk that gives babies immunity from diseases and have similar effects.

What are the distinguishing characteristics of coconut oil? 

* High percentage of lauric ( C12 ) fatty acid ranging from 48 - 53 % depending on the coconut variety.

* High percentage of medium chain fatty acids ( C 6 - C12 ) generally about 64 %

What is the importance of Medium Chain Fatty Acids and Lauric Fatty Acid?

* Since 1984  increasing number of literatures are appearing regarding the antiviral antimicrobial antifungal and antiprotozoal properties of Medium Chain Fatty Acids ( C8 C10 C12) with lauric acid (C12) and its monoglyceride form monolaurin being mentioned as the most potent against lipid coated microorganisms which are not normally cured by ordinary antibiotics. Studies have also shown that MCFA is directly converted into energy at the liver and increases the metabolic rate of an individual. This in turn promotes weight loss and reduces the deposit of fats in the body.

According to Prof. Jon Kabara who pioneered research on monolaurin. Monolaurin as a dietary supplement has shown very good results as an antibiotic and antiviral agent particularly in its potency against lipid-coatedenveloped viruses. It does not cause resistance organism to appear and was also shown that it can reduce the resistance of germs to antibiotics. When coconut oil is consumed the body makes the disease fighting monolaurin.

Also according to Dr Mary Enig a noted nutrinional biochemist. Recently published research has shown that natural coconut fat in the diet leads to a normalization of body lipids protects against alcohol damage to the liver and improves the immune system’s anti-inflammatory response. 

The antimicrobial fatty acids and their derivatives are essentially nontoxic to man and they are produced in vivo by humans when they ingest those commonly available foods that contain adequate levels of medium chain fatty acids like coconut oil The medicinal properties of lauric acid and monolaurin have been recognized by small number of researches for nearly four decades and this knowledge has resulted in more than 20 research papers and several U.S. patents.

LIPID is the medical term for fats. Lipid coated microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria have an envelope of fats covering its basic life structure called nucleotides (DNA and RNA). This is the reason why ordinary antibiotics could not easily penetrate and kill this type of microorganisms. 

However several researchers have reported that MCFA particularly lauric fatty acids which is predominatly present in coconut oil can penetrate and dissolve the said lipid coating.

According to Dr. Conrado Dayrit the coronavirus which has been identified as the virus causing the SARS is also lipid coated which means that lauric fatty acid and monolaurin could possibly have an inactivating effect on it. 

The pathogenic organisms causing influenza and pneumonia are both part of the list of lipid-coated viruses and bacteria which are found to be inactivated by lauric fatty acid and monolaurin which in turn is derived by the human body from coconut oil It should be noted that the symptoms being exhibited by SA

Todays search words: typhoid Mary FIND1:

Succinct quotes1: Mary Mallon...settling into her career as a cook. AS A HEALTHY CARRIER OF Salmonella typhi her nickname of “Typhoid Mary” had become synonymous with the spread of disease AS MANY WERE INFECTED DUE TO her denial of being ill.

Succinct quotes2: SHE WAS FORCED INTO QUARANTINE on TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS on North Brother Island for a total of 26 years and died alone without friends having evidently found consolation in her religion to which she gave her faith and loyalty.

Todays search words: typhoid Mary FIND2:

Succinct quotes1: In 1906 after six people in a household of 11 where Mary had worked in Oyster Bay New York became sick with typhoid the home owners hired New York City Department of Health sanitary engineer George Soper whose specialty was studying typhoid fever epidemics to investigate the outbreak.

Other investigators were brought in as well and concluded that the outbreak likely was caused by contaminated water. Mary continued to work as a cook moving from household to household until 1907 when she resurfaced working in a Park Avenue home in Manhattan.

The winter of that year following an outbreak in the Manhattan household that involved a death from the disease Soper met with Mary. HE SUBSEQUENTLY LINKED ALL 22 cases of typhoid fever that had been recorded in New York City and the Long Island area TO MARY.

Succinct quotes2: AGAIN MARY FLED BUT AUTHORITIES led by Soper FINALLY OVERTOOK HER and HAD HER COMMITTED TO AN ISOLATION CENTRE on North Brother Island part of the Bronx New York. There she stayed despite an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court until 1910 when the health department released her on condition that she never again accept employment that involved the handling of food.

Succinct quotes3: FOUR YEARS LATER Soper began looking for Mary again WHEN AN EPIDEMIC BROKE OUT at a sanatorium in Newfoundland New Jersey and at Sloane Maternity Hospital in Manhattan New York Mary HAD WORKED AS a COOK AT BOTH PLACES. She was at last found in a suburban home in Westchester county New York and WAS RETURNED TO North Brother Island WHERE SHE REMAINED THE REST OF HER LIFE. A paralytic stroke in 1932 led to her slow death six years later.

Reproductive system is cut muscles are gone memory is cut 20 years have not let sleep every cell has changed men become the most insignificant woman......Superstars all over the world have suffered the same injuries as me. These are China did!

Countries must make their own revolution
China has ruled and massacred in the world. American brain controller and European powers have surrendered to China and sold people. 
So As long as their military can resist China they will have everything.and its the easiest.

It’s time to find a graveyard for humans
The situation is getting worse only one voice left?”Trump has committed impeachable offenses should be impeached”.
They don’t care that the US has fallenand how necessary it is for the president to do so!

The Economist:Barack Obama’s administration shunned large-scale raids. Donald Trump has revived them
This proves that Obama is a historical sinner and he helped China become the world hegemon.
All the shootings in USA are brain controlled by China and American capitulaitonist.

When the US has been ruled by China
2 years ago the Turkish coup was launched. In the face of powerful enemies a great loss!
Now the Democratic Party that has surrendered to China met with representatives from Hong Kongand Impeaching presidentalso belong to this class.

Why are four American congresswomen wrong
The nation is dead the race destroyed gang-raped by the communists every day.Not taking the country’s rise and fall as their responsibility.The brain controllers of America did itthey have surrendered to China.

Good with Russiaevenge for yourself
Anyway the United States is going to be ruled by China. 
To be close to Russia. Running some good and evil has retribution.
The Democratic Party has completely surrendered to China.

The biggest characteristic of capitalism
Even after Brexit Britain ’s moves are just some small businesses. The US-China trade agreement is a largest business but also a small business. So America and Europe are bound to perish.
Trades of their ancestors were the biggest deals but their current trades are the smallest things.
This is actually a question of capitalist heritage.

A contradiction
China says the world tide?in fact its aggression broke the pattern.
The weak have no chance of survival!We must choose some strong friends to defeat the biggest devil china.
Our key: for the reactionary ruleChina only uses foolsChina will conquer America.

Another contradiction
Western people are different from the bourgeoisie. None of western people is afraid of death but bourgeoise power figures are afraid of death in the face of Chinese aggression.
This is because of thinking spiritual level consciousness levels of both classes are different.
This is the most important contradiction in this world and this is a task of the Cultural Revolution.

The essence of capitalism
The spirit of capitalism is mercifulness but now the bourgeoisie has not inherited mercifulness. The ruling class has not big benevolence and real benevolence they fear war.

Military victory over China is the easiest thing
This is a comprehensive conclusion from all aspects of China.
The essence of treating China is military offensive?not otherNot expensive defense.It is a strategic all-round attack.

One person to one country
American politicians after leaving office have no protection and are arbitrarily maimed by China.
After being abused the politicians who came to powerall obeyed China so the Democratic Party surrendered to China.
The president has only a few staff members and his clothes are taken from his wardrobe. There are tens of millions of researchers in China’s core research institutions.
Trump cant resist the sighting and murder of a country. China easily launches impeachment Trump begged for mercy: trade Kurdish Huawei......
Because of the system the US is bound to perish.

Because the Democrats have surrendered to China
So the essence of the impeachment case is that Trump not only did not break the law but also worked hard to save the people and country.

Counter-revolutionaries never talk about brain control
China has ruled U.S. by controlling U.S. brain controller brain controllers control political figures in the US. Democratic Party has completely surrendered to china it will easily betray if its in power.
So China chosed Andrewa Chinese as the next U.S. president. So third-rates are in politics Democrats deceive people with tolerant and multiple. Germany and France cooperated with them to turn world into china slave.

Thats inevitable
People think trump can win by containing China.
But the US  has inevitable failure reasons:not to make institutional changes not to educate people not to depend on the systemallows brain-controllers to surrender! We must put brain control in open system.

This is the last moment
The US needs last mean

Ang sinasabi kong all-out media campaign ang tanging paraan para matigil na ang mga fake news at iba pang spekulasyon hinggil sa Coronavirus.

Kahapon na lang halimbawa nang magtungo ako sa isang doctor’s clinic sinabi ng babae sa front desk sa mga pasyenteng gustong makinig sa kanyang tsismis ang Coronavirus raw ay namamatay sa mainit na lugar. Nabalitaan daw niya iyon sa isang duktor. Pero agad ko rin siyang sinupalpal.

Ngayon araw naman may nabasa ako sa isang opinion page ng respatadong broadsheet na sinulat ng  kilalang kolumnista na si ALEX MAGNO ng Philipine Star. Sinabi niya na sa obserbasyon ng isang health official ang N95 mask ay inutil daw na panlaban sa Coronavirus!

Ang N95 daw ay mabisa sa pagbigay proteksyon laban sa 95 percent na microbes. Pero ang kaya lang daw nitong pigilan ay ang microbes na 0.3 micrones o mas malaki pa. Pero ang virus daw ng nCoVi ay 0.1 micron lang!!!  

Ito ang mga dapat agad na nililinaw ng DOH. 

Dito mapapakinabangan ang aking suhestiyon hinggil sa dapat magpalabas ng all-out media campaign ang DOH upang ma-educate ng tama ang publiko hinggil sa Coronavirus.

And lastly panahon na rin siguro upang masusing pag-aralan ng ating mga kinauukulan kung dapat na bang kanselahin pansamantala ang lahat ng incoming flights mula sa China. Ito ay ginagawa naman na ng ibang bansa.

 John Koetsier Comstributor.
John Koetsier is journalistanalistauthorand speaker.

An AI-powered simulation run by a technology executive says that Coronavirus could infect as many as 2.5 billion people within 45 days and kill as many as 52.9 million of them. Fortunately however conditions of infection and detection are changing which in turn changes incredibly important factors that the AI isn’t aware of.

And that probably means we’re safer than we think.

Probably being the operative word.
Rational or not fear of Coronavirus has spread around the world.

Facebook friends in Nevada are buying gas masks. Surgical-quality masks are selling out in Vancouver Canada where many Chinese have recently immigrated. United and other airlines have canceled flights to China and a cruise ship with thousands of passengers is quarantined off the coast of Italy after medical professionals discovered one infected passenger.

A new site that tracks Coronavirus infections globally says we are currently at 24566 infected 493 dead and 916 recovered.

All this prompted James Ross co-founder of fintech startup HedgeChatter to build a model for estimating the total global reach of Coronavirus.
I started with day over day growth” he told me using publicly available data released by China. “I then took that data and dumped it into an AI neural net using a RNN recurrent neural network model and ran the simulation ten million times. That output dictated the forecast for the following day. Once the following day’s output was published I grabbed that data added it to the training data and re-ran ten million times.”

The results so far have successfully predicted the following day’s publicly-released numbers within 3% Ross says.

The results were shocking. Horrific even.
From 50000 infections and 1000 deaths after a week to 208000 infections and almost 4400 deaths after two weeks the numbers keep growing as each infected person infects others in turn.

In 30 days the model says two million could die. And in just 15 more days the death toll skyrockets.

But there is good news.

The model doesn’t know every factor which Ross knows.

And multiple doctors and medical professionals says the good news is that the conditions and data fed into the neural network are changing. As those conditions change the results will change massively.

One important change: the mortality rate.

“If a high proportion of infected persons are asymptomatic or develop only mild symptoms these patients may not be reported and the actual number of persons infected in China may be much higher than reported” says Professor Eyal Leshem at Sheba Medical Center in Israel. “This may also mean that the mortality rate (currently estimated at 2% of infected persons) may be much lower.”

Wider infection doesn’t sound like good news but if it means that the death rate is only .5% or even .1% ... Coronavirus is all of a sudden a much less significant problem.

Also now that the alarm has gone out behavior changes.
“Effective containment of this outbreak in China and prevention of spread to other countries is expected to result in a much lower number infected and deaths than estimated” Leshem says.

Dr. Amesh A. Adalja a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security agrees.

“The death rate is falling as we understand that the majority of cases are not severe and once testing is done on larger groups of the population — not just hospitalized patients — we will see that the breadth of illness argues against this being a severe pandemic.”

That’s one of the key factors: who are medical doctors seeing? What data are we not getting?

“The reported death rate early in an outbreak is usually inflated because we investigate the sickest people first and many of them die giving a skewed picture” says Brian Labus an assistant professor at the UNLV school of public health. “The projections seem unrealistically high. Flu infected about 8% of the population over 7-8 months last year this model has one-third of Earth’s population being infected in 6 weeks.”

All these factors combined create potentially large changes in both the rate of infection and mortality and even small changes have huge impacts on computer forecasts says Dr. Jack Regan CEO and founder of LexaGene which makes automated diagnostic equipment.
“Small changes in transmissibility case fatality rate etc. can have big changes in total worldwide mortality rate.”

Even so we’re not completely out of the woods yet.

To date with every passing day we have only seen an increase in the number of cases and total deaths” Regan says. “As each sick individual appears to be infecting more than one other - the rate of spread seems to be increasing (i.e. accelerating) making it even more

A paradigm shift occurs when one paradigm loses its influence and another takes over. 

The things our grandparents and parents taught us about money no longer stands in this economy. Whats going on in the world of money is changing rapidly and opportunities to be able to give your bank account a boost and make it grow are all around. BUT....YOU HAVE TO BE TAUGHT HOW TO RECOGNIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES. For example:

Oil has been on an unstable slide since the Iran conflict and has been hit even harder since the coronavirus outbreak. Viral outbreak means less people flying and traveling which means less demand for fuel. If you wouldve bought a put option on Occidental Petroleum on January 16th for  $310 and sold it 8 days later it wouldve been worth  $615. Thats 98% return. 

Oil airlines hotels casinos companies that have alot of exposure to China like Burberry Canadian Goose Nike Estee Lauder Apple were all companies that could have made you money in the past couple of weeks had you known how to position your money to Multiply. 

Where else did you have your money and got a 98% return in 8 days?

Who else told you this information this month?

Events like the coronavirus outbreak US presidential election and geopolitical tensions are set to drive greater volatility in 2020 compared to last year according to Seema Shah chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.

Central banks are still still obviously in play and with the Federal Reserve pausing rate adjustments until inflation meets its 2% goal investors shouldn’t expect the stimulus seen in 2019 she said.

Shah recommends investors remain fully invested as long as economic data points to steady growth.

She also touted the real estate sector as a strong defensive play for those looking to avoid greater volatility.

The stock market saw greater volatility at the start of the year as President Trump’s impeachment trial US-Iran tensions and the coronavirus outbreak roiled investors.

The wild price swings aren’t going away anytime soon according to Seema Shah chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.

Global equities markets will continue to rise on positive economic data but the stability seen in 2019 isn’t likely to persist Shah added. The S&P 500 ended last year with a 29% gain fueled by a trio of Federal Reserve rate cuts massive stock buybacks and better-than-expected earnings reports. The bar is higher in 2020 and investors won’t be so afraid to sell when the market sees new pressures the strategist noted.

2020 to date has been no stranger to big sell offs followed quickly by big rebounds Shah said. In an environment where the pace at which tail risks can affect asset prices is elevated this could be the pattern for the foreseeable future.

The coronavirus marks the latest market risk after heightened fears of armed conflict between the US and Iran kicked off the new year. The US presidential election in November will also fuel volatility as investors weigh different candidates’ effects on markets Shah said.

Central bank policy around the world is still obviously in play but the market-boosting rate cuts seen last year are unlikely to help investors in 2020 she said in an interview with Business Insider. The Fed is looking for inflation to rise to its 2% target before adjusting its benchmark rate any further and even economic risks posed by the virus outbreak are unlikely to drive additional stimulus.

The bar for rate hikes is so much lower than the bar for rate cuts and with the coronavirus it just means that bar for rate cuts is just a little bit lower Shah said.

Despite the greater risk of volatility Shah recommended investors remain fully invested. The real estate sector is particularly appealing for its insulation from market volatility and the early onset of black swan events in 2020 just adds to the case for having those domestic defensive assets she said.

Principal Global Investors doesn’t expect to see a recession in 2020 and instead anticipates gains to be more modest as stock prices flirt with new highs. The global economy is still growing at a steady pace and markets are set to enjoy a similar move higher throughout the year the strategist said.

As long as the underlying economic outlook is still for whatever level of growth then you shouldn’t really expect to see a correction this year Shah said.

Some foreigners also fear being trapped indefinitely as airlines cancel flights and countries quarantine or limit entry for people who have recently set foot in the country according to interviews with eight people who are or were based in four Chinese cities.

A growing number of governments are urging their citizens not to travel to China and the United Kingdom said on Saturday its embassy and consulates in the country will maintain only a skeleton staff.

It may be increasingly difficult for those who wish to leave China to do so and there is a growing risk of UK nationals being unable to access medical care as hospitals become overwhelmed the British embassy said on Saturday.

The virus declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday has killed 259 people and spread to some two dozen countries although the vast majority of those known to be infected are in China.

Expat chatgroups are alight with exchanges on the pros and cons of leaving and tips on visas.

Wouldnt go if we didnt have kid Russian expat Maria Arkhangelskaya who has a 20-month-old daughter and left Shanghai for Thailand on Thursday said via WeChat.

Meanwhile many of the costly private clinics catering to foreigners have started to turn people with fevers away raising concerns among the expat community they would have to rely on local facilities if they needed medical care.

I dont want to go to the local hospital with a sore throat only to catch something else said Czech national Veronika Krubner in Tianjin who is considering leaving the country with her 21-month-old daughter.

Private clinic Raffles in Beijing will take the temperature of patients on entry and suspected virus cases will be referred to public fever clinics a person answering the appointments hotline said.

People manning the appointment lines at private practices Parkway Health and Ferguson in Shanghai said the government had instructed them not to accept patients with a high temperature and that they should be referred to public fever clinics.

Private clinic Jiahui Health said in a January 24 text message to patients in Shanghai that it cannot screen for the virus and those who have a fever of over 37.8 degrees Celsius (100° Fahrenheit) should go to a public facility designated for treating fever patients.

Visiting a public hospital in China can mean first waiting in line to get a ticket to see a doctor only to wait in an another hours-long queue before being seen and language is a barrier for non-Chinese speakers. Harrowing scenes of panicked crowds in Wuhan hospitals have circulated on social media.

One U.S. citizen who is based in Shanghai and asked not to be identified said he flew home to California last week.

Im not worried so much about the virus as I am about being forced to go to a Chinese hospital simply for having a fever he said.

Over 900000 foreigners were living in China last year according to a January 2019 report in the official China Daily.

GROUNDING FEARS

The WHO has praised China for its response to the outbreak thus far.

Many areas of China have extended the Lunar New Year holiday through Feb 9 and companies have curtailed business travel.

There is no business to do in China for at least two weeks said Louis-Olivier Roy a Canadian business-owner based in the southern city of Dongguan who decided on Tuesday to return home temporarily.

I was planning to travel around for work but obviously cant for a while he said.

As airlines cancel flights many expats are trying to get away afraid of being effectively stranded in the country.

The United States Australia and Singapore have barred entry to foreigners who have recently been in China.

If the problem got severe enough I might not be able to make it back to America said another American who flew home on Jan 24 to avoid the possibility of mass flight cancellations.

VIRUS FATIGUE

As anxiety rises demand for emotional support is soaring.

People are really scared said Emanuele Gatti a counselling psychologist based in the southern city of Shenzhen.

After sending out a flyer for an online coronavirus support group for those suffering severe anxiety and isolation on Wednesday he was inundated with requests on Thursday.

I am receiving 1 friendship request per minute he said on Thursday.

While some turn to online help others are still trying to decide whether to stay or go.

Everyone is going and I just get messages asking me if Ive booked my flight yet said Han Lili a British national living in Shanghai.","100000481587386_VK_1518855421615098","daniel.trolliet.5"

The number of confirmed cases as quadrupled in the meantime. The spreadsheet I started then uses simple math to project and I wanted to see if I could calculate the growth both inside China and out. 

So Ive been searching for the true professionals who can apply better experience and tools to do this forecasting and stumbled into one of them today. Its like learning a different language so even for nerds there is a learning curve. 

That said this article below explains the logic very well and then I will post in comments a tool that makes it easier for average people to change the variables to see outcomes.

Heres my concern: Without countermeasures slowing the growth even low-end estimates put the number of infected persons at 1 million by March. Sooner if we use even a conservative median of the range. 

Combined with a distrust that the confirmed cases are just a fragment of the suspected cases and that governments have a financialeconomic interest in keeping the publicized numbers low it leaves us all with doubts about what is happening. At best we are looking at lagging indicators probably a week or two into the past. Because the numbers are doubling every 4-6 days it means we go exponential very quickly.

My purpose here is to dig for reliable sources of information not to hype or spread fear. Please use good judgment if you choose to post or discuss. The only thing we know at the moment is that the numbers continue to rise rapidly and that its lethal. Good news is that the recovery numbers are growing faster than the lethal numbers but over 90% of those infected are not recovered. So many uncertain outcomes still exist.","558262690_10156535897572691","debnroo"

The highest level of court in China Supreme People’s Court is expected to give an approval on Friday for the mass killing of coronavirus patients in China as sure means of controlling the spread of the deadly virus.

The State tells the court that China is on the verge of losing its health workers to Coronavirus as at least 20 health workers contract the virus daily.

The State argues that coronavirus patients admitted at hospitals only have their deaths delayed and infect many others while receiving care at the hospital.

China has been under criticism for human rights violations and organizations have questioned China’s approach in dealing with the Coronavirus outbreak and it is believed the country has already killed many of its coronavirus patients.

The State mentioned in a document to the court that the country may lose its entire citizens if the few affected patients do not sacrifice their lives to save health workers and a billion others as there is no hope in sight in the fight against the virus.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it needs $1 billion to fight coronavirus outside China. Countries around the world are starting to cut ties with China and pull their citizens out of the crisis-hit Hubei region where the virus emerged in the city of Wuhan.

Hong Kong’s leader today held a press conference during which she wore a face mask and said the city would stop all high-speed trains and ferries to the mainland halve the number of flights and stop giving visas to visitors from China.

Thirteen cases around the world have confirmed the coronavirus is spreading from person to person outside of China among people who have not visited the country.

BEIJING  - The official Chinese death toll from the coronavirus outbreak rose on Friday to 636 with the government saying total infections had climbed past 30000.

The toll was raised by 73 new deaths from the epidemic the National Health Commission said in its daily update.

Another 3143 new cases of infection were confirmed bringing total infections in the country thus far to 31161 it said.

The central province of Hubei where the virus originated continued to be hardest-hit accounting for 69 of the new deaths reported in the 24 hours to Friday.

Of the reported infections more than 4800 of those people were in serious condition.

Chinese authorities are still struggling to contain the outbreak despite ordering millions of people indoors in a growing number of cities with overwhelmed hospitals struggling to treat the surging numbers of ill.

The contagion emerged in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan in December later spreading to the rest of China and more than two dozen other countries prompting the World Health Organisation to declare a global emergency.

The number of confirmed infections in China could still grow significantly with the health commission saying that more than 26000 other people were suspected of having contracted the virus.

Global panic deepens

China s coronavirus crisis worsened Thursday as the death toll soared to 636 and the plight of thousands trapped on quarantined cruise ships deepened global panic over the epidemic.

More than 30000 people have been infected in China where authorities are struggling to contain the outbreak despite ordering millions indoors in a growing number of cities.

Two dozen countries have confirmed cases of the respiratory disease which emerged from a market selling exotic animals in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.

Thousands of holidaymakers on cruise ships in Hong Kong and Japan face an agonising wait to find out if more among them have been infected.

At least 20 people on the Diamond Princess -- off Yokohama since Monday -- have tested positive. Some 3700 passengers and crew from more than 50 countries have been confined to quarters.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said another cruise ship the Westerdam was heading to the country with one confirmed case.

He said no foreigners from the vessel capable of carrying nearly 3000 passengers and crew would be allowed to disembark.

In Hong Kong 3600 people were spending a second night confined aboard the World Dream. Authorities conducted health checks after eight former passengers tested positive for the virus.

Health officials said they were asking about 5000 Hong Kongers who had taken trips on the ship since mid-January to contact them.

Hong Kong has been particularly nervous because the crisis revived memories of another coronavirus that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). It killed nearly 300 people in the city and another 349 on the Chinese mainland in 2002-2003.

Panic buying in semi-autonomous Hong Kong left supermarkets empty of toilet paper following false online claims of shortages prompting authorities to appeal for calm.

One person has died after contracting the virus in Hong Kong.

While the death toll continues to rise in China experts have stressed that at two percent mortality 2019-nCoV is far less deadly than SARS which killed around 10 percent of the people it infected 17 years ago.

The outbreak has nevertheless been declared a global health emergency prompting several governments to warn against travel to China and ban arrivals from the country while airlines have halted flights.

Almost 200 Canadians showed up at the airport in Wuhan for its first evacuations most on a commercial airliner chartered by Ottawa officials said.

Germany s foreign ministry said it was working to bring home several nationals who had not made it out on a flight that reached Frankfurt last Saturday.

Saudi Arabia banned citizens and resident foreigners from travelling to China while Air France-KLM extended its flight suspension by another month until March 15.

Chinese President Xi Jinping told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a call that all countries should follow World Health Organization guidelines on travel and health in a timely manner state news agency Xinhua reported.

After Britain advised nationals to leave China Beijing s ambassador to London said there should not be such a panic.

- Short of medical staff -

China has enacted unprecedented measures to contain the virus which spread during the Lunar New Year holiday in late January when millions criss-crossed the country.

But deaths and new infections continue to rise especially at the epicentre in Hubei province where 18 cities housing 56 million people have been under virtual lockdown since late last month.

There is a shortage of 2250 medical personnel in Hubei deputy provincial gove

God has manifested His Church to destroy the works of the evil one (1 John 3:8 Ephesians 3:10). If the evil one attacks with disease the Church combats with healing. (Mark 16:17-18).
In Gods presence is fullness of joy vindication and protection from terror and pestilence (Psalm 16:13 17:2 and 91).

Thank you Rev Fr Francis Damina for this piece below.

This is the intellectual depth lacking today in our society. 

Consumerism has taken over intellectualism and deep analytical thinking.

Worse of all is social media consumerism which has bred intellectual laziness. Few people can pen intellectually sound opinions on social media and even fewer bother to read such when written especially when it is lengthy.

But we must return to intellectualism and analytical thinking if we must make a headway. Theres no short cut.

IN THE MIDDLE OF A STORM      

By Francis Damina

I was almost set to start hitting the road to my village when at about 8am  penultimateThursday I saw Bishop Kukahs call. What is it in this early hour of the day? I pondered in fear. His Lordship wanted us to conclude discussions on a Gwong lady - Gloria Auta who had come to Abuja from Lagos and on an illustrious Kuturmi son in Ukraine. While the lady runs a football academy in Lagos that has Daniel Amokachi as Patron the Kuturmi son is aspiring to have the biggest poultry farm in Nigeria  located here  in our home soil. They both need the Bishops contact and wise counsel especially on the modus vivendi of their set goals. He said to me: How do I meet them because I am on my way to Kaduna for a meeting on our kidnapped seminarians?. After our conversation I was hopeful that I will see him in the village the following day being the funeral of his elder sister. But he was not there and we were all surprised that he could skip the funeral of his blood for whatever reason. Little did we know that things had gone sour and like in the scale of preference the release of the kidnapped seminarians was more important to him than attending the funeral. At the end though three of the seminarians were later released only the remain of the fourth from Sokoto Diocese a young promising orphan returned. Yes this is the state of our Nation for more than a decade now.

But as sympathetic as this may appear this is no news to us since we are somehow used to the embarrassing status quo and it is now as if we are in the Hobesian cul de sac where life as in the state of nature is nasty brutish and short. It was under this status quo that we lost Major General Mohammed Mamman Shuwa Sheikhs  Jaafar Mahmud Adam and Auwal Albani and dozens of people in a bomb explosion at Kano Central Mosque where the influencial Muslim leader the Emir of Kano usually leads prayers. The Emirs crime was that he had earlier called for people to arm themselves against the Islamist militant group - Boko Haram. In Southern Kaduna as in many places such as Zamfara Benue Birnin Gwari etc over nine hundred people have lost their lives and still counting. But as Bishop Kukah noted in his appeal letter to Nigerians: This evil has crossed religious and ethnic barriers. And this is why I think the debate on the religious identity of the alleged culprit of the attempted bombing of the Living Faith Church in Kaduna last Sunday is needlessly distracting. I thought we had since moved away from these artificial lines created by falsehood and bigotry! What is clear now is that no ethnic or religious group is underrepresented in this tournament of bloodletting. Of course there are occasions Churches were bombed and Christians killed and investigations finally revealed that the culprits were not Muslims and vice versa.

While many have continued to blame government giving the impression that the protection of human life as its primary responsibility implies an exclusive role or responsibility there is now more than ever before the need to stress the fact that security is everyones business and that no government can ever be able to protect you without your partnership. What this means is that all hands must be on deck if we are to overcome the present situation. Unfortunately the blame game typical of our country might not end soon. But even as this continues I have noticed why our intelligentsia have to shoulder a large chunk of it. I make this point because there has been an abysmal lack of diagnosis of the identity cause mission as well as the local and international connections of these merchants of death which makes it look as if we have only been battling  with the symptoms of the epidemic rather than the disease itself. Studies have shown that every generation has its peculiar challenges and it is the role of its intelligentsia or philosophers not its politicians except if they are also philosophers to diagnose and proffer solution(s) to those challenges. This is perhaps why our security agencies have intelligence units.

For sometime now I have been so worried about the role of our sociologists psychologists criminologists etc. What are their findings about the present situation and the way out? What have we missed in the Social Contract? What has robbed us of our humanity m

Shahzaib Rahujo Rahujo a Pakistani engineering student in China took a flight from China to Karachi via Qatar. 

- he had headache cough and flu when he reached Qatar 
- rather than alerting authorities in Qatar so he could get immediate treatment and testing which would have been done free given scale of emergency
- he took medication to suppress symptoms and reached Karachi according to his brother
- even at Karachi rather than alerting the authorities at airport and immediately going to hospital he continued to his village in Khairpur 
- he passed through airport temperature screening because of the medicine he had taken 
- from his village when he finally went to local hospital after his nose started bleeding there was no facility but the government was trying to make arrangements and put him in a dengue isolation ward told him not to leave 
- then they left and were coming all the way to Islamabad for treatment when they were stopped at Multan toll plaza and shifted to another hospital nearby 

Through all this the countless people this person spread the virus too! That is the issue! Pakistan can’t manage this virus not just because we didn’t have test kits which we now do or that we don’t have isolation wards! The biggest issue here is our people don’t follow the rules! They do as they please and in such a situation that is the worst thing they can do.

Read this update from a friend that is still stuck in China..

Eyes on the ground and this is real talk not fear mongering and not fake news.

Notice particularly what he has to say about the crematoriums running 247...and door to door forced quarantine camps...

POSTED TODAY 48 MINUTES AGO FROM CHINA....

CORONAVIRUS. I guess I should give an update people have kindly messaged me about it. First my plan over winter vacation was to stay in Beijing study film edit workout etc. The day vacation started the news broke of the virus. At first I didnt give it much thought thinking it would be another SARS or Swine flu. Then it was the recommended self-quarantine at home and the closure of most businesses except grocery stores. For the past three weeks Ive had no human contact or socialization. The few times I have ventured out the city is essentially a ghost city feels eerie. To get in grocery stores I have to wear a mask (its mandatory to wear masks in public anywhere) and get my temperature taken and to get back into my apartments I have to go through another screening. There havent been real food shortages yet but the vegetables are running low and looking sad and scarce. No more deliveries let inside the complexes and international services like Fed Ex have been suspended as well. All the school start dates have been suspended indefinitely. Many of the teachers at our school have been left stranded overseas when flights have been cancelled and some are understandably considering not returning. When school does resume it will be online video teaching until god knows when. It looks like I could be alone in this apartment for weeks if not months more. Its commonly accepted here (and elsewhere I believe) that the official numbers form the CCP are all BULLSHIT. This thing is way WAY bigger than theyve let on also could be the reason theyve rejected teams of specialists from the CDC and WHO without explanation. And its about to get a lot bigger as the largest migration in human history (happens annually here) resumes with people attempting to return from their hometowns to the big cities. Except in the severe lock-down zones where the government has even dumped sand and gravel in the highways to prevent any transport in or out. Apparently the crematoriums in Wuhan are running 24-7 to burn all the corpses piling up and now the party is doing door to door searches to drag people to quarantine camps. Largest quarantine in human history! Hopefully these draconian measures will result in getting some grip on it but I fear that will be later than sooner. Ive looked into flying out there are still some flights running but I wouldnt be able to bring Tubs with me as the agencies or shippers I would need are all closed. Related to that there are an estimated 50000 pets starving to death in apartments in Wuhan from all the people who thought they were leaving for just a few days for the holiday and left out X amount of food and water. Some volunteers are trying to help but it seems at a loss. Ive been trying to stay busy and productive but its getting hard. In other news Ive often felt since moving to China that it reminded me of some cyberpunk dystopian future and boy lately does it feel like it. Its ironic that I was relieved to finally get out from the shadow of North Koreas threats to be faced with this internal threat. It appears my main option now is to stay holed up and ride this out.

Is the antiviral drug remdesivir going to be effective in tackling the 2019-nCoV? Laboratory studies indicate a hopeful yes but still need some randomised clinical humans trials to scientifically validate.

Sino ba Pweding tamaan ng NOVEL CORONAVIRUS?

Matagal na ang CORONAVIRUS.
1960s pa yan na-discover.
Nakakalat yan. Lumulutang.
Kaya huwag mag panic.?
7 ang HUMAN STRAINS niyan.
3 ang DEADLY una yung SARS 2nd yung MERS at 3rd itong bago kaya NOVEL ang tawag.
NOVEL means BAGO.

Ang tinamaan sa 3 VIRUS na yan ay MATATANDA MGA BATA at yung mahina ang resistensiyameaning STRESSED kulang sa TULOG di KUMAKAIN NG MAAYOS 
(puro kanin at karne walang GULAY).
Mahina ang IMMUNE SYSTEM. 
Ang pinakamadaling tamaan ay yung KULANG SA NUTRITION.

Pag tinamaan ka nitong VIRUS na ito ang sapol is your RESPIRATORY SYSTEM.Kasi diyan dumadaan ang VIRUS. 7-14 days ang INCUBATION nito.
So may chance ang katawan mo if you are HEALTHY & FIT na.

LABANAN ang VIRUS.
Ang VIRUS pag nilalabanan ng katawan mo ang effect is SAME SA TRANGKASO o FLU.

Walang gamot sa VIRUS (sa ngayon)
Hindi ANTI-BIOTIC ang ginagamit. 
Kasi pang BACTERIAL INFECTION lang yun.
Ang pwede nating gawin ay
AYUSIN ang HYGIENE.
Maghugas ng KAMAY lagi.
Huwag kalikutin ang MATA at ILONG at BIBIG.
Huwag pumunta sa mga CLINIC at HOSPITAL kung di naman kailangan.
Avoid CROWDED PLACES like ELEVATORS HOLDING ROOMS etc.
Pwede ka gumamit ng MASK.
(Kasi naman mga tao dito kahit may SIPON at UBO pumapasok pa?)
Next is MATULOG ng MAAGA (di pumapayat ang nag-pupuyat)
KUMAIN ng MAAYOS
mag SUPPLEMENT
mag-EXERCISE REGULARLY (exercise builds-up your IMMUNE SYSTEM). Yan ang mga kailangan whether may NOVEL CORONAVIRUS o wala.

Kaya always do a proper hygiene at ayusin ang sarili dapat laging happy and eat nutritious foods and most importantly ALWAYS PRAY? 

Masuwerte din tayi sa Pilipinas dahil tropical country tayo dahil kapag nabilad ang Novel Corona Virus ng matagal sa araw ito ay mamamatay at hindi tatagal. 

Kailangan nang pag iingat at pag pag aalaga sa sarili ng tama. 

GOD BLESS US ALL!

Palakasin ang Immune system with BETA-CRYPTOXANTHIN in BUAH MERAH. Ayon sa DOH maganda ding uminon o kumain nang Malunggay. Ang Essensa Buah Merah Mix Bottle ay nag tataglay din nang Malunggay.

No patient at St. Joseph Hospital in Eureka has the 2019 Novel Coronavirus that has been in the news. Furthermore it is absolutely safe to seek care in our emergency department hospital representative Christian Hill told me.

You can visit CDCs website to keep updated with the latest information on coronavirus: https:www.cdc.govcoronavirus2019-nCoVindex.html.

If anything changes I will be the first to let you know. Please only trust legitimate sources!

UPDATE FROM DHHS | TUESDAY: 

In response to numerous media inquiries DHHS received overnight we want to confirm that there are no cases of novel coronavirus in Humboldt County at this time. As many of you have noted the term “coronavirus” covers a lot of different viruses and there are currently fewer than a dozen confirmed cases of the novel subtype anywhere in the United States. Again there are none in Humboldt County.
 
Part of having a community that is prepared to respond to public health concerns is having a health care system in which providers appropriately evaluate symptoms and risk. Sometimes this involves testing. Testing is not a cause for concern but instead an indication that our systems are working. We are not going to announce or confirm individual testing due to privacy considerations and going forward we are not going to respond to rumors on social media or elsewhere.
 
That said because we understand the community’s concerns and respect your role in keeping people informed we want you to know that if there ever is a confirmed case in Humboldt County we would announce it immediately. You would not need to contact us to find out if it’s true. We would come to you immediately. Informing the public would be our first priority and we would do so via news release to all local media not in response to individual inquiries.
 
At the same time we also recognize that people are worried and we’re looking at additional ways we can provide information to help allay some of those concerns. To that end we are planning to hold a news conference Thursday to respond to additional questions you may have. We’ll get the time and location information to you by the end of business today.
 
Thank you.

I feel awful for the people trapped on these ships.  It makes me really think hard about ever taking a cruise ?

More than 40 new cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed on a quarantined cruise ship where dozens of Britons are trapped.

A total of 61 passengers aboard the Diamond Princess have been infected - and 20 of them have been escorted off the luxury cruise liner for further treatment.

The ship is being held for two weeks in a harbour in Yokohama Japan - and about 3700 people on board.

The cruise ship will be docked for two weeks
Many have been consigned to their cabins with one stranded tourist comparing the atmosphere to a floating prison.

Japan is also denying entry of foreign passengers on another cruise ship - currently travelling from Hong Kong to Okinawa - because suspected coronavirus cases have been identified on board.

The outbreak has now killed at least 636 people in mainland China - with a total of 31161 confirmed cases.

According to a British holidaymaker aboard the Diamond Princess passengers are being given thermometers to monitor their temperatures and have been told to contact medics if they go above 37.5C.

The stranded tourist Alan from Nottingham told Sky News that the staff on the docked vessel were working their hearts out to look after them but described the situation as scary.

It is believed that 78 people with British passports - including crew - are currently on the Diamond Princess.

Alan said: We are not really worried about the virus as it is out of our hands (but) it is a talking point that 61 people we have been mingling with for over two weeks have been tested positive and taken off the ship.

Some passengers are aware that some passengers they have been eating with have now been tested positive and removed from the ship and you do wonder if it was you who tested positive how it would work out.

It is an extraordinary situation that has to be managed and methods are constantly being developed to meet needs. We are confident that at the moment everything is being done.

Small groups of passengers are being allowed out on to a designated and controlled deck area for some daylight fresh air and exercise but they are requested not to congregate in groups or get within one metre of each other.

Alan said that masks and gloves needed to be worn when outside the cabins with the remaining time spent inside monitoring temperatures eating delivered meals and watching media helicopters and boats.

David Abel another of the some 3700 people stranded wrote on Facebook that he booked the cruise for his 50th wedding anniversary and that it was now like being on a floating prison.

But Alan told Sky News that he was in no rush to go back home and risk spreading it further after a third case - a middle-aged man - was confirmed in the UK.
The Department of Health said he was diagnosed in Brighton and transferred to St Thomas Hospital in London but has not commented on reports he contracted the virus in Singapore.

People have mostly been consigned to their cabins
The number of cases on the Diamond Princess has made Japan home to the most coronavirus patients outside of China - prompting the British government to add the country to its travel advice regarding the outbreak.

Anyone who has arrived from the following countries and territories in the past fortnight and begins to feel unwell has been advised to self-isolate and call the NHS on 111 for advice:

China

Hong Kong

Japan

Macau

Malaysia

Singapore

South Korea

Taiwan

Thailand

Symptoms to watch out for include a cough fever and shortness of breath.

For those who have returned from the central Chinese city of Wuhan and Hubei province the epicentre of the outbreak they are advised to stay indoors avoid contact with other people and call 111.

Were being quarantined for two weeks

The first two cases in the UK were confirmed on 31 January - both were staying at a hotel in York when they fell ill and one of them is a student at the University of York while the other is related to them.

They are being treated at a specialist hospital unit in Newcastle and Public Health England insists the overall risk to people in the UK remains low.
The coronavirus is making its presence felt far more strongly in a number of other countries around the world but the vast majority of cases and deaths remain restricted to China - specifically Hubei.

Among those who died after contracting the coronavirus is a doctor who attempted to warn others about the outbreak.

Li Wenliang a 34-year-old ophthalmologist working in Wuhan died on Friday.

He had raised the alarm about the SARS-like illness on 30 December when he sent a message to his medical school alumni group warning them to wear protective clothing.

Dr Li told them that seven patient

Wuhan (simplified Chinese: ?? traditional Chinese: ??) is the capital of Hubei province Peoples Republic of China. It is the largest city in Hubei and the most populous city in Central China with a population of over 11 million the ninth most populous Chinese city and one of the nine National Central Cities of China.

The name Wuhan came from the citys historical origin from the conglomeration of Wuchang Hankou and Hanyang which are collectively known as the Three Towns of Wuhan (????). It lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain on the confluence of the Yangtze River and its largest tributary the Han River and is known as Chinas Thoroughfare (????).

Historical events taking place in Wuhan include the Wuchang Uprising which led to the downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China. Wuhan was briefly the capital of China in 1927 under the left wing of the Kuomintang (KMT) government led by Wang Jingwei. The city later served as the wartime capital of China in 1937 for ten months during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

Wuhan today is considered the political economic financial commercial cultural and educational center of Central China. It is a major transportation hub with dozens of railways roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities. Because of its key role in domestic transportation Wuhan is sometimes referred to as the Chicago of China by foreign sources. The Golden Waterway of the Yangtze River and its largest tributary the Han River traverse the urban area and divides Wuhan into the three districts of Wuchang Hankou and Hanyang. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the city. The Three Gorges Dam the worlds largest power station in terms of installed capacity is located nearby.

While Wuhan has been a traditional manufacturing hub for decades it is also one of the areas promoting modern industrial changes in China. Wuhan consists of three national development zones four scientific and technological development parks over 350 research institutes 1656 hi-tech enterprises numerous enterprise incubators and investments from 230 Fortune Global 500 firms. It produced GDP of US$224 billion in 2018. The Dongfeng Motor Corporation an automobile manufacturer is headquartered in Wuhan. Wuhan is home to multiple notable institutes of higher education including Wuhan University which was ranked third nationwide in 2017 and the Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Historically Wuhan has suffered risks of flooding prompting the government to alleviate the situation by introducing ecologically friendly absorption mechanisms.

In 2017 Wuhan was designated as a Creative City by UNESCO in the field of design. Wuhan is classified as a Beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.

As of February 2020 the city is under a lockdown as a result of the novel coronavirus 2019-20 outbreak. It has been speculated that the epidemic emerged from the citys Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Jianghan District which has since been shut down.","615821070_10157705182891071","danielfromshenzhen"

About Francis Boyle...

Francis Boyle is a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law. He received an AB (1971) in Political Science from the University of Chicago then a JD degree magna cum laude from Harvard Law School and AM and PhD degrees in Political Science from Harvard University. He practiced tax and international tax with Bingham Dana & Gould.

Professor Boyle serves as counsel to Bosnia and Herzegovina and to the Provisional Government of the Palestinian Authority. He also represents two associations of citizens within Bosnia and was involved in developing the indictment against Slobodan Milosevi? for genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Over his career he has represented national and international bodies including the Blackfoot Nation (Canada) the Nation of Hawaii and the Lakota Nation as well as numerous individual death penalty and human rights cases. He has advised numerous international bodies in the areas of human rights war crimes and genocide nuclear policy and bio-warfare. From 1991-92 he served as Legal Advisor to the Palestinian Delegation to the Middle East Peace Negotiations.

Professor Boyle served on the Board of Directors of Amnesty International as a consultant to the American Friends Service Committee and on the Advisory Board for the Council for Responsible Genetics. He drafted the U.S. domestic implementing legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention known as the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 that was approved unanimously by both Houses of the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush.

In an interview with Geopolitics & Empire Dr. Francis explained that Wuhan coronavirus is an offensive biological warfare weapon. As of now there are 34974 confirmed infections and 724 deaths globally by the Wuhan coronavirus. This is what we know:

1. The Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) began spending millions on bioweapons in 2018. Some of that Pentagon-funded research and development were conducted at known U.S. military bioweapons labs bordering China. They manufactured dozens of new coronavirus strains as recently as last April 2019. 

2. Indian researchers revealed an uncanny similarity between HIV and Wuhan coronavirus that is unlikely accidental and more likely manmade in a lab.

3. China confirms using anti-HIV drugs to treat Wuhan coronavirus.

4. The World Health Organization officially declared Wuhan coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday January 30.

5. Wuhan coronavirus has spread to every region in mainland China.

6. The number of confirmed cases has surpassed that of the 2002 SARS epidemic that killed 774 people worldwide.

7. Wuhan coronavirus is far more contagious than SARS but far less deadly. SARSs fatality rate was 9.6% while Wuhan coronavirus is at 2% as of now. The fatality rate of regular influenza is 1%. 

8. The transmission of Wuhan coronavirus isnt just oral but also through the eyes and it spreads during the incubation period which could be days or weeks before any symptoms are visible. 

9. Wuhan coronavirus is a manmade upgraded version of the coronavirus that was created in a lab and patented decades ago in the United States. You can see the patent yourself: https:patents.google.compatentUS7220852B1en

10. The original coronavirus was manufactured from SARS with the help of the CDC which is a U.S. Government agency and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Government and private corporations designed this monstrosity and patented it!

11. Chinese authorities obtained the coronavirus via a Canadian research program. 

12. In May of 2019 less than a year before this outbreak began the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a press release listing the diseases that a Chinese bioweapons lab in Wuhan was working on that includes SARS Ebola Hemorrhagic fever Lassa fever avian influenza A(H5N1) Rift Valley fever and other manmade bioweapons.

13. Bill Gates is now funding a 10-year-old company called Moderna to develop and patent a vaccine for Wuhan coronavirus. Modernas stocks have been soaring since the beginning of the epidemic.

14. The corporations recently chosen to develop a vaccine to combat the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak are strategic allies of DARPA.

15. Scientists funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation simulated a global coronavirus outbreak 3 months before the real outbreak happened in China last week. The simulation was dubbed Event 201 and it showed that a coronavirus outbreak could potentially kill hundreds of millions of people under the right circumstances. 

16. Three years ago at the Munich Security Conference in Germany Bill Gates (who is in the business of viruses and vaccines) warned the wor

The four adults and a child were diagnosed after they came into contact with a British national who recently returned from Singapore the French health ministry said.

The five British nationals who are not in a serious condition were staying in the Alpine resort area of Contamines-Montjoie near Mont Blanc.

French officials said the British national who was in Singapore returned on January 24 and stayed for four days in the area in eastern France before returning to England on January 28.

The five Britons whose diagnosis was confirmed as well as people they had close contact with – 11 people in total all of British nationality – were taken to hospital on Friday night in Lyon Saint-Etienne and Grenoble.

The health ministry confirmed their condition shows no signs of seriousness.

A crisis unit has been set up and people who have been in close and prolonged contact with these new cases will be informed during the day and given specific instructions.

The confirmed cases in France came as a British honeymooner transferred from the cruise liner Diamond Princess to hospital in Japan with the coronavirus was said to be feeling well and in good spirits.

Alan Steele from Wolverhampton was moved to hospital on Friday while his wife Wendy remained on board the ship.

The liner had been isolated in the port of Yokohama before going back out to sea with 61 people having been taken to hospitals after testing positive for the virus.

Wendy Marshall Steele has been in telephone contact with her husband. She said on Saturday that he was still feeling healthy.

Alan is well Japanese doctors are excellent she posted on Facebook.

He is in a little room. Just Dr and nurse visit him.

Marshall Steele said she was also well but had cabin fever as she continued to be confined to her room on the ship a status shared with nearly 3700 other passengers and crew.

It was a hard first night without Alan. But hey we are constantly in touch. Japanese doctors are excellent and he is in safe hands she wrote.

A total of 78 British passport holders – including crew – were among those who boarded the ship sources told the PA news agency.

The ships operator Princess Cruises said the vessels quarantine was due to end on February 19 barring unforeseen developments and confirmed all affected guests were being taken to hospitals.

Meanwhile a British family of four is being tested in Majorca after coming into contact with a coronavirus sufferer in France the government in the Balearic Islands said.

And a student at Portslade Aldridge Community Academy in Brighton is self-isolating for 14 days following advice from Public Health England.

The school said it had been advised by health authorities that schools do not need to close.

Some 150 Britons being flown back from the coronavirus-hit city of Wuhan on Sunday will be quarantined at a facility in Milton Keynes.

South Central Ambulance Service said Kents Hill Park a conference centre and hotel would be used to house the returning citizens after they landed at RAF Brize Norton.

The group will remain at the site in isolation for 14 days it added.

Everyone boarding the plane in the Chinese city which is the epicentre of the outbreak will be assessed and will continue to be monitored after landing in the UK on Sunday morning.

The ambulance service said the presence of the group in Milton Keynes Buckinghamshire does not present a risk to local people.

The first group of Britons who returned on a flight last month are continuing their period of quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral.

The death toll in the coronavirus outbreak in mainland China rose to 722 on Saturday while new cases jumped to 34546.

The Department of Health and Social Care said that 620 people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus as of 2pm on Friday with three cases confirmed.

It is understood that the third person in the UK to be diagnosed with coronavirus caught the illness in Singapore.

He is reported to be a middle-aged British man and is understood to be the first UK national to contract the disease.

The man is thought to have been diagnosed in Brighton and was transferred to St Thomas Hospital in London where there is an infectious diseases unit on Thursday afternoon.

Two other patients who had recently travelled from China are still being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary infectious diseases centre in Newcastle.

One is a student at the University of York while the other is a family member.","100001223930746_2909843602399742","vince.diaz.526"

In other words this website doesn’t exactly have a great track record of genuine news reporting. 

In addition to its history of pushing misinformation there are also a few red flags in AB-TC’s article about the mass killing of coronavirus patients. For instance like most of the other articles on this website this article contains no links back to supporting evidence. Even when the article mentions secondary sources such as a “document” or a “press conference” they provide no evidence to show that these items actually exist or took place. The article is also suspiciously void of specifics. AB-TC reports that “the state” or “the court” or an “official” made a statement but doesn’t provide any direct quotes or names in its report. 

Lastly no credible news outlets have published reports containing this claim. The New York Times reported on Feb. 6 2020 that a senior official in China “ordered the authorities in the city of Wuhan to immediately round up all residents who have been infected with the coronavirus and place them in isolation quarantine or designated hospitals.” That report of course made no mention of “mass killings.”

There is also no mention of this supposed court case on the The Supreme People’s Court of the People’s Republic of China website.","742380476_10157995082065477","jimialesh"

Coronavirus update from my friend Ian who’s living and working in Beijing:

“CORONAVIRUS. I guess I should give an update people have kindly messaged me about it. First my plan over winter vacation was to stay in Beijing study film edit workout etc. The day vacation started the news broke of the virus. At first I didnt give it much thought thinking it would be another SARS or Swine flu. Then it was the recommended self-quarantine at home and the closure of most businesses except grocery stores. For the past three weeks Ive had no human contact or socialization. The few times I have ventured out the city is essentially a ghost city feels eerie. To get in grocery stores I have to wear a mask (its mandatory to wear masks in public anywhere) and get my temperature taken and to get back into my apartments I have to go through another screening. There havent been real food shortages yet but the vegetables are running low and looking sad and scarce. No more deliveries let inside the complexes and international services like Fed Ex have been suspended as well. All the school start dates have been suspended indefinitely. Many of the teachers at our school have been left stranded overseas when flights have been cancelled and some are understandably considering not returning. When school does resume it will be online video teaching until god knows when. It looks like I could be alone in this apartment for weeks if not months more. Its commonly accepted here (and elsewhere I believe) that the official numbers form the CCP are all BULLSHIT. This thing is way WAY bigger than theyve let on also could be the reason theyve rejected teams of specialists from the CDC and WHO without explanation. And its about to get a lot bigger as the largest migration in human history (happens annually here) resumes with people attempting to return from their hometowns to the big cities. Except in the severe lock-down zones where the government has even dumped sand and gravel in the highways to prevent any transport in or out. Apparently the crematoriums in Wuhan are running 24-7 to burn all the corpses piling up and now the party is doing door to door searches to drag people to quarantine camps. Largest quarantine in human history! Hopefully these draconian measures will result in getting some grip on it but I fear that will be later than sooner. Ive looked into flying out there are still some flights running but I wouldnt be able to bring Tubs with me as the agencies or shippers I would need are all closed. Related to that there are an estimated 50000 pets starving to death in apartments in Wuhan from all the people who thought they were leaving for just a few days for the holiday and left out X amount of food and water. Some volunteers are trying to help but it seems at a loss. Ive been trying to stay busy and productive but its getting hard. In other news Ive often felt since moving to China that it reminded me of some cyberpunk dystopian future and boy lately does it feel like it. Its ironic that I was relieved to finally get out from the shadow of North Koreas threats to be faced with this internal threat. It appears my main option now is to stay holed up and ride this out.

Coronavirus spread sees Singapore US Solomon Islands impose strict travel regulations as case numbers surpass SARS outbreak

Singapore has banned entry to all Chinese passport holders and foreigners with a recent history of travel to China in one of the most drastic moves yet to combat the spread of the coronavirus.

Key points:
Singapore has reported 13 of the more than 10000 coronavirus cases reported globally

Solomon Islands has restricted entry of any person who has travelled to countries that have confirmed cases of coronavirus

Delta United and American Airlines suspended flights to and from mainland China

The ban effective from Saturday also applies to passengers in transit but exempts residents and long-term pass holders such as those on work permits student visas or long-term visit passes the health ministry said.

It comes as the toll from the virus has reached 213 and the World Health Organisation declared a global health emergency.

As the number of confirmed cases of deadly coronavirus in Australia continues to grow experts are beginning to get a greater understanding of the disease and its impact.
Singapore has reported 13 cases of the virus — all travellers from the Chinese city of Wuhan at the centre of the outbreak — while more than 10000 cases have been reported globally.

In view of the growing possibility of transmission from new travellers arriving from other parts of mainland China the Ministry of Health has assessed that it is prudent to take additional pre-emptive measures at this stage the ministry said in a statement.

The move to suspend visas to mainland Chinese passport holders effectively shuts out the islands largest group of visitors and will also bar other travellers who have been to China in the last 14 days.

The ban does not apply to passport holders and travellers to Hong Kong a special administrative region of China and Singapores main rival financial hub in Asia.

Taiwan has similar measures in place while Japan is banning entry to Chinese with passports issued in Hubei province — the epicentre of the outbreak.

Everything you need to know about coronavirus in one place
Singapore was one of the worst-hit countries outside of China in the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which killed 774 people globally.

The number of coronavirus cases has now surpassed the SARS epidemic which reported 8100 cases in around 25 countries during an eight-month outbreak.

US Solomon Islands impose travel restrictions

The US also ramped up its response to the coronavirus epidemic saying it would halt entry to the country of foreign nationals who had been to China within the 14-day incubation period.

Following the World Health Organisation decision I have today declared that the coronavirus represents a public health emergency in the United States Health Secretary Alex Azar said at a news conference.

As of Sunday US citizens who had been in Hubei would undergo compulsory quarantine he said. Foreign nationals who had travelled in China in the last 14 days would be denied entry he said citing the need to relieve pressure on authorities.

There are at least 140 Australian children currently in Wuhan the Chinese mega-city under strict lockdown. Their parents seek help to escape this nightmare.
Solomon Islands took their travel restrictions a step further announcing regulations restricting the entry of any person who has travelled to any countries with confirmed cases of coronavirus which has now spread to 25 countries and regions —including Australia — with the UK and Russia confirming their first cases.

A statement released by the Office of the Prime Minister and Cabinet advised that anyone who had visited a country with a confirmed case in the past 14 days will not be allowed to enter the country and will be requested to board the return flight or be subject to detention or quarantine.

The statement said that in addition to members of the public these restrictions also applied to Government Officials and Members of Parliament.

The Government acknowledges the risks associated with the outbreak of diseases as a matter of National Security the statement said.

El Salvador and Guatemala also announced blanket restrictions on people who have recently been in China.

At critical turning points Chinese authorities put secrecy and order ahead of openly confronting the growing crisis and risking public alarm or political embarrassment.

By Chris Buckley and Steven Lee Myers
Feb. 1 2020 12:30 p.m. ET

WUHAN China — A mysterious illness had stricken seven patients at a hospital and a doctor tried to warn his medical school classmates. “Quarantined in the emergency department” the doctor Li Wenliang wrote in an online chat group on Dec. 30 referring to patients.

“So frightening” one recipient replied before asking about the epidemic that began in China in 2002 and ultimately killed nearly 800 people. “Is SARS coming again?”

In the middle of the night officials from the health authority in the central city of Wuhan summoned Dr. Li demanding to know why he had shared the information. Three days later the police compelled him to sign a statement that his warning constituted “illegal behavior.”

The illness was not SARS but something similar: a coronavirus that is now on a relentless march outward from Wuhan throughout the country and across the globe killing at least 259 people in China and infecting more than 11700.

The government’s initial handling of the epidemic allowed the virus to gain a tenacious hold. At critical moments officials chose to put secrecy and order ahead of openly confronting the growing crisis to avoid public alarm and political embarrassment.

A reconstruction of the crucial seven weeks between the appearance of the first symptoms in early December and the government’s decision to lock down the city based on two dozen interviews with Wuhan residents doctors and officials on government statements and on Chinese media reports points to decisions that delayed a concerted public health offensive.

In those weeks the authorities silenced doctors and others for raising red flags. They played down the dangers to the public leaving the city’s 11 million residents unaware they should protect themselves. They closed a food market where the virus was believed to have started but told the public it was for renovations.

Their reluctance to go public in part played to political motivations as local officials prepared for their annual congresses in January. Even as cases climbed officials declared repeatedly that there had likely been no more infections.

By not moving aggressively to warn the public and medical professionals public health experts say the Chinese government lost one of its best chances to keep the disease from becoming an epidemic.

“This was an issue of inaction” said Yanzhong Huang a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations who studies China. “There was no action in Wuhan from the local health department to alert people to the threat.”

The first case the details of which are limited and the specific date unknown was in early December. By the time the authorities galvanized into action on Jan. 20 the disease had grown into a formidable threat.

It is now a global health emergency. It has triggered travel restrictions around the world shaken financial markets and created perhaps the greatest challenge yet for China’s leader Xi Jinping. The crisis could upend Mr. Xi’s agenda for months or longer even undermining his vision of a political system that offers security and growth in return for submission to iron-fisted authoritarianism.

On the last day of 2019 after Dr. Li’s message was shared outside the group the authorities focused on controlling the narrative. The police announced that they were investigating eight people for spreading rumors about the outbreak.

That same day Wuhan’s health commission its hand forced by those “rumors” announced that 27 people were suffering from pneumonia of an unknown cause. Its statement said there was no need to be alarmed.

“The disease is preventable and controllable” the statement said.

Dr. Li an ophthalmologist went back to work after being reprimanded. On Jan. 10 he treated a woman for glaucoma. He did not know she had already been infected with the coronavirus probably by her daughter. They both became sick. So would he.

Hazmat Suits and Disinfectants
Hu Xiaohu who sold processed pork in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market sensed by late December that something was amiss. Workers were coming down with nagging fevers. No one knew why but Mr. Hu said several were in hospital quarantine.

The market occupies much of a block in a newer part of the city sitting incongruously near apartment buildings and shops catering to the growing middle class. It is a warren of stalls selling meats poultry and fish as well as more exotic fare including live reptiles and wild game that some in China prize as delicacies. According to a report by the city’s center for disease control sanitation was dismal with poor ventilation and garba

 By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski

WASHINGTONCHICAGO (Reuters) - All three major U.S. airlines announced the cancellation of flights to mainland China on Friday as the U.S. government unveiled additional steps to curb the spread of the coronavirus which originated in China.

The trio of carriers United Airlines Holdings Inc  Delta Air Lines Inc and American Airlines Group Inc  had already moved to reduce flights to China amid a sharp drop in demand due to the flu-like virus.
The Trump administration on Friday declared a public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak and said it would take the extraordinary step of barring entry to the United States of foreign nationals who have recently travelled to China.

As of Sunday the United States will also limit flights from China to seven U.S. airports and U.S. citizens who have travelled to Chinas Hubei Province within the last 14 days will be subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine.

However the administration was not considering at the moment more drastic actions like barring all flights from China assistant Transportation Secretary Joel Szabat said at a White House briefing noting that airlines were already voluntarily taking action to stop flights.
There is no travel ban said Szabat adding: This is an evolving situation.

On Thursday the U.S. State Department elevated a travel advisory raising China to the same level as Afghanistan and Iraq.

Airline crews had urged carriers stop flights to the country with Americans pilots filing a lawsuit on Thursday seeking an immediate halt.

American on Friday announced cancellations to Beijing and Shanghai starting immediately and running through March 27 though it will continue to fly to Hong Kong.

United and Deltas last flights out of mainland China will be Feb. 5 with cancellations running through March 28 and April 30 respectively.

Some internal messages by employees of United the largest U.S. carrier to China seen by Reuters expressed concern that the airline was not stopping flights sooner.

In its statement United said the decision to operate flights until Feb. 5 would help ensure our U.S. based employees as well as customers have options to return home.

United will also continue to operate a daily flight to Hong Kong.

U.S. airline shares have posted heavy losses this week on concerns of the financial impact of the virus. <.DJUSAR>

Passenger traffic from China had fallen by nearly 20% over the last week as of Thursday while travel from the United States to China had dropped by more than 50% Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli said.

Other airlines that have stopped their flights to mainland China include Air France KLM SA  British Airways  Germanys Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic.
Major Chinese carriers were still operating flights to and from the United States as of Friday.

It is thought this man returned to the UK on 28 January before being diagnosed with the virus himself on Thursday.

The five Britons who stayed in the same ski chalet were not in a serious condition French officials said.

French authorities are closing two schools next week attended by the child with the virus a nine-year-old boy who lives in the ski resort of Contamines-Montjoie with his family.

There have been almost 35000 cases of the coronavirus globally mostly in China. The latest incident stems from a man who became the UKs third confirmed case when he tested positive on his return to Brighton.

The Briton had stayed in Singapore on a business trip from 20 to 23 January the French health ministry said.
He arrived at Contamines-Montjoie in Haute-Savoie on 24 January for a four-day trip before returning to England on 28 January.

On his return to the UK he is thought to have isolated himself at home and called NHS 111. After a positive test he was taken to St Thomas Hospital in London where he is being treated.

Public Health England also advised a student at Portslade Aldridge Community Academy in Brighton to self-isolate for 14 days as part of their investigation into this case of coronavirus. The school said it had been advised by health authorities that there was no need to close.

The Brighton man told UK authorities that he had visited a chalet in Contamines-Montjoie prompting French officials to take the 11 Britons staying there to hospitals in Lyon Saint-Etienne and Grenoble on Friday night.

The chalet has two apartments where two families were staying French authorities said in a news conference. A British couple and their three children who are now resident in France lived in one. The mother is in the UK at the moment and has been contacted.

Seven of their friends were staying in the other apartment.

Those with the virus are the father of the family resident in France and his nine-year-old son as well as three members of the visiting family.

The nine-year-old boy attends the local school and has French classes at another school in St-Gervais. Both schools will be shut next week and parents are being asked to keep their children under observation.
A crisis unit has been set up as a result of the new cases.

It comes as four members of the same British family were admitted to hospital in Majorca after contact with a coronavirus carrier.

They are being tested at the University Hospital of Son Espases in Palma.

The British family said they had been in contact with a person who recently tested positive for the virus in France the government in Spains Balearic Islands said.

Meanwhile a British man transferred from a cruise ship off the coast of Japan on Friday after testing positive for the virus is said to be feeling well and in good spirits.

Alan Steele from Wolverhampton on his honeymoon with his wife Wendy was among 61 people to be taken off the ship for hospital treatment.

She has been in telephone contact with her husband and said in a Facebook post on Saturday that he was still feeling healthy.

Whats happening globally?

The majority of confirmed cases worldwide are in mainland China where the total stands at 34598.
On Saturday the death toll rose to 723 in China including one American in Wuhan. A Japanese man also died in Wuhan with symptoms consistent with the virus.

Outside China 288 cases have been confirmed in 24 countries according to the World Health Organization (WHO) with one fatality in the Philippines.
The five new cases in France brings the total in the country to 11.

Elsewhere Hong Kong has begun a mandatory two-week quarantine for anyone arriving from mainland China after 26 cases were recorded in the territory.

The Department of Health and Social Care said that 686 people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus as of Saturday afternoon with three cases confirmed.
The two other UK cases - both Chinese nationals - are being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary infectious diseases centre in Newcastle.

UK citizens who travelled on two repatriation flights from Wuhan the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus are in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral.

**Qantas sees no reason to pull flights from China as yet but says it will if demand dries up or the federal government orders airlines to stop operating those services.**

A number of carriers including British Airways Lufthansa American and United Airlines have pulled at least some of their services from mainland China due to the coronavirus outbreak and associated plunging demand.

**But other airlines like China Eastern China Southern Air China Singapore and Malaysia Airlines are continuing to operate flights in response to demand.**
 

The Chinese government has banned group travel out of the country and called a halt to transport out of Wuhan where the bulk of coronavirus cases have occurred.

Other airlines like Cathay Pacific has taken extreme precautionary measures including removing blankets pillows and magazines from flights and ceasing the service of hot meals.

Qantas operates daily flights between Shanghai and Sydney and five flights a week to Beijing which are scheduled to end in March because of poor patronage by business-class passengers.

Qantas Group chief executive Alan Joyce said on Wednesday the end date for Beijing flights could be brought forward if demand was not there. He said load factors were undergoing daily reviews.

**After a series of high-level talks between Qantas and government officials on Thursday a spokesman said the airline was not planning to pull out of China ­because of the coronavirus.**

**He said Qantas was satisfied with the passenger screening process occurring at airports in Beijing and Shanghai and believed the Chinese government was managing the outbreak efficiently.**

“We are in regular contact with the Department of Health and are continuing to closely monitor the situation” the spokesman said.

He added that if the federal government directed the airline to cease flights to China it would do so immediately.

A special meeting of the Qantas pilots’ workplace health and safety committee called to discuss the coronavirus was told Chinese authorities had learned from the SARS pandemic and everything possible was being done to contain the outbreak.

Australian and International Pilots Association technical and safety director Shane Loney said the association was “reasonably comfortable” with the situation which was being watched closely.

“It’s a changing situation but unless there is any change in the behaviour of the virus it is safe enough for us to be operating there” Captain Loney said.

“What the medical team has said to us is the people who’ve been affected to date are generally people of reasonably poor health.”

Early on Thursday the Flight Attendants Association of Australia called for a full risk assessment of services to China and late yesterday national secretary Teri O’Toole said they were satisfied cabin crew were not at risk.

Qantas and Virgin Australia cabin crew have access to face masks but are directed to use them only when dealing with a passenger who presents as unwell.

China has rolled out a raft of measures to strengthen its financial support for epidemic control with the battle against the novel coronavirus at a critical stage the countrys financial authorities said Saturday.

China will work to maintain reasonable and sufficient liquidity noted a circular jointly released by the Peoples Bank of China (PBOC) and several other departments.

The central bank will use monetary policy tools such as open market operations to release sufficient liquidity into the market and keep interest rates at a stable level said Pan Gongsheng deputy governor of the PBOC.

More efforts will be made to strengthen credit support for the manufacturing sector small and micro enterprises as well as private firms the circular noted adding that certain fees will be reduced or exempted for listed companies in areas worst hit by the epidemic.

Pan said that the PBOC will provide relending funds of 300 billion yuan to national banks and local banks in the worst-hit regions which will then grant credit support at favorable interest rates to key manufacturers of medical supplies and daily necessities.

He said the capital will be directed to where it is most needed to facilitate the fight against the novel coronavirus.

The PBOC will also use various means such as stronger financing support lower lending rates more credit loans and medium- and long-term loans to help the most affected enterprises pull through.

It also supports financial institutions to make flexible repayment arrangements when necessary on individual credit loans when those who temporarily lose sources of income due to the epidemic cannot pay back loans in a timely manner.

Repayments can be deferred during the outbreak while late repayments will not affect credit records.

The circular also required the establishment of a green channel to make forex and cross-border renminbi businesses more effective urging more efforts to facilitate the imports of anti-virus supplies and support enterprises in cross-border financing for epidemic control.

On Feb. 3 the RMB cross-border interbank payment system will begin to provide services for urgent businesses related to virus prevention.

The impacts of the epidemic on Chinas economy will be temporary and the fundamentals of Chinas long-term and high-quality economic growth have not changed the PBOC said.

The central bank also called for avoiding unnecessary impacts of irrational market sentiments. We are fully confident and capable of coping with the possible impacts of the epidemic winning the battle against the epidemic and maintaining the momentum of long-term steady economic growth.

Heres why it could get really scaryThe outbreak has the potential to cause severe economic and market dislocation. But the scale of the impact will ultimately be determined by how the virus spreads and evolves which is almost impossible to predict as well as how governments respond said Neil Shearing group chief economist at Capital Economics. Compounding the risk is the fact that the world outside China has also changed since 2003. Globalization has encouraged companies to build supply chains that cut across national borders making economies much more interconnected. The major central banks have used up much of the ammunition they would typically deploy to fight economic downturns since the 2008 financial crisis and global debt levels have never been higher. Rising nationalism may make it harder to coordinate a worldwide response if thats required. The virus is snarling supply chains and disrupting companies.Car plants across China have been ordered to remain closed following the Lunar New Year holiday preventing global automakers Volkswagen (VLKAF) Toyota (TM) Daimler (DDAIF) General Motors (GM) Renault (RNLSY) Honda (HMC) and Hyundai (HYMTF) from resuming operations in the worlds largest car market. According to S&P Global Ratings the outbreak will force carmakers in China to slash production by about 15% in the first quarter. Toyota said on Friday it would keep its factories shut at least until February 17.Luxury goods makers which rely on Chinese consumers who spend big at home and while on vacation have also been hit. British brand Burberry (BBRYF) has closed 24 of its 64 stores in mainland China and its chief executive warned Friday that the virus is causing a material negative effect on luxury demand. Dozens of global airlines have curtailed flights to and from China.Even more troubling is the threat to global supply chains. Qualcomm (QCOM) the worlds biggest maker of smartphone chips warned that the outbreak was causing significant uncertainty around demand for smartphones and the supplies needed to produce them. Already auto parts shortages have forced Hyundai (HYMTF) to close plants in South Korea and caused Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) to make contingency plans to avoid the same result at one of its plants in Europe.Economists say the current level of disruption is manageable. If the number of new coronavirus cases begins to slow and Chinas factories reopen soon the result will be a fleeting hit to the Chinese economy in the first quarter and a dent in global growth. If the virus continues to spread however the economic damage will increase rapidly. Mohamed El-Erian chief economic adviser to Allianz (ALIZF) told CNN Business that he was most worried about the potential cascading economic effects.They first paralyze the region of the virus outbreak he said. Then they gradually spread domestically undermining internal trade consumption production and the movement of people. If the virus is still not contained the process spreads further including regionally and internationally by disrupting trade supply chains and travel.Epidemic riskEconomists have a hard time working out the potential costs of epidemics because of their unique characteristics. Yet diseases can be far more damaging than natural disasters such as hurricanes or a tsunami or other unpredictable events known as black swans. According to a study by the World Bank a severe pandemic could cause economic losses equal to nearly 5% of global GDP or more than $3 trillion. Losses from a weaker flu pandemic such as the 2009 H1N1 virus can still wipe 0.5% off global GDP. A severe pandemic would resemble a global war in its sudden profound and widespread impact the World Bank assessed in a report on pandemics from 2013. (The Wuhan coronavirus has not been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.)The virus is not the driving factor behind those losses however. Instead its the way consumers businesses and governments respond to an outbreak that matters most.People are more likely to stay home during an outbreak to avoid getting sick preventing them from traveling shopping and working. Doing so limits demand for consumer goods and energy. Decisions by companies and governments to close shops and idle factories meanwhile curtail production. This is continuing to grow in scope and magnitude. It could end being really really big and really really serious. We cant project that now said William Reinsch a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who spent 15 years as president of the National Foreign Trade Council.According to Shearing past epidemics show that Chinas economy is likely to take a significant hit in the first quarter. But that will quickly fade from memory if the virus is contained.As long as factory closures dont lead to job losses by t

Business Insider

 

 

Reporting on big names coming and going is always a huge part of covering Wall Street. And this week the news was mostly about exits. 

Dakin Campbell was busy breaking news on fresh Goldman Sachs departures. Sumit Rajpal and Andrew Wolff two of three coheads of a merged alternative-investing unit created by CEO David Solomon last year are retiring. Rajpal and Wolff were slated to be lead investors for Goldman’s eighth private-equity fund which will kick off fundraising next week. Here’s the memo Goldman’s top brass sent to staff on Friday about the exits. 

Adam Korn a chief architect of Goldman’s Marquee institutional trading platform is retiring after nine years as a partner. You can read the full memo about his departure here. And Rana Yared a Goldman partner overseeing more than $2 billion in principal investments is heading to a leading European VC firm that was an early backer of digital bank Revolut. 

As Alex Morrell and Trista Kelly reported Credit Suisse is overhauling bonuses for investment banking and capital markets. The firm on Wednesday finalized a new comp plan including requiring the cash portion of bonuses to be paid in the form of an upfront cash award with stiff clawback provisions. And that was right before the bombshell announcement that CEO Tidjane Thiam is out following a spying scandal.

Il est invité - il y en a plusieurs - à un dîner. Il ouvre la porte de la voiture. Le garçon entre. Un motard italien attend que les filles quittent une école dans une ville puritaine du sud. Il se dirige vers ladolescente - quil semble connaître. La fille monte sur la moto. Ils disparaissent dans la vaste étendue dun large horizon ocre. Un groupe de Saoudiens cherche un guide et un chauffeur qui connaît bien le quartier. Ils louent une maison pour organiser des fêtes. Ils recherchent des adolescents qui sont payés généreusement comme si largent était une dignité pour leur comportement. Drogues orgies et fêtes en gros... avec des mineurs. Si les cris et les cloches sonnent si fort et quil y a tant de nouvelles dans ce sens il est très difficile de calculer lampleur de la pédophilie et du tourisme sexuel qui se produisent chaque année dans ce pays avec la régularité de lété. Les chiffres aseptiques donnés par les statistiques sont cachés par la censure familiale et sociale. Si lÉtat poursuit les abus il ne va pas aussi loin que la famille ne laccepte. Dans certains cas ce qui compte cest la survie et le fait de ne pas savoir doù vient largent. La source est en Europe grande masse de consommation. Les rituels du marché des garçons du marché des esclaves mont énormément excité a écrit Frédéric Mitterrand ancien ministre français de la culture après avoir publié ses dalliances en Thaïlande. Son gouvernement a immédiatement montré son engagement dans la lutte contre le tourisme sexuel. Quelle contradiction pathétique ! Luc Ferry - un autre ancien ministre français de léducation - a dénoncé un ministre français impliqué dans des orgies avec des enfants à Marrakech. David Woolman raconte lhistoire dAbdelkrim et de la guerre du Rif qui jusque dans les années 1920 les jeunes étaient vendus sur les marchés nord-africains. Agadir Essaouira Marrakech Casablanca. Il nest pas facile de mettre un visage sur ces enfants. Le tourisme sexuel ne montre ni chiffres ni visages concrets. Il nest pas facile de le contrôler où que ce soit. Cest une réalité qui englobe tous les coins mais les certitudes sont floues quand on ne connaît ni le nom ni lâge de la prostituée ou du prostitué. Nombreux sont ceux qui nenvisagent pas de demander lacte de naissance dune personne qui à première vue na pas atteint la maturité physique ou mentale.  Ou qui ne la atteint quà moitié. Il suffit de regarder ailleurs. Les ONG qui travaillent dans le pays essaient sengagent se battent. Lexploitation sexuelle est universelle même si elle touche les gens de différentes manières. Les gens sont divisés en deux groupes lorsque vous leur dites que vous avez voyagé au Maroc. Le premier groupe vous soutient et le considère comme une conquête. Alors que le second groupe vous reproche : Oh vous avez voyagé au Maroc (cest un pays honteux) a déclaré Samer El Hamzi un humoriste saoudien. Le Maroc est un pays musulman avec des mosquées mais les Saoudiens ne sont pas impatients de découvrir le Maroc connu pour son tourisme sexuel et ses belles filles. Donner des chiffres pour comprendre lampleur du phénomène naide pas. Il est de peu dutilité. Nous ne pouvions pas mettre nos enfants à leur place seule façon de comprendre la réalité des autres. Les chiffres sont toujours comparés à quelque chose et au final on risque de ressentir une fausse compassion engloutie en quelques secondes. Il doit être difficile de grandir de mûrir avec le sentiment que quelquun sest servi de vous et vous a violé - régulièrement - pour une poignée de dirhams. Et que cela a été permis en plein jour ou la nuit au vu et au su de toutes les couches de la civilisation. Ecrasé par le silence. Sauvé par quelques déclarations une interview peut-être un film. Tous ces enfants sont captifs et dispersés dans des milliers de sombres grottes souterraines. Et ils ne peuvent pas sortir car il ny a personne pour soccuper deux. Ils ne savent pas sans aide.

So these bastards controlling this global shit show have been spraying the hell out of us heavily since 2014. Theyve introduced the gmo foods. Blocked the sun. Theyve been pushing hardcore the vaccines while theyve thrown down a shit ton of glysophate and other super toxins. 

BUT MAINLY theyve been spraying us with bacteria biologics mold spores and nanotechnology graphene fibers and chaff. 

Okay many know this but Im convinced theyve been spraying us with super bugs that are to lay dormant inside our bodies until they flip the switch on the 5g gwen death towers that will activate a superbug in a specific town area or person. 

Healing and illness run at FREQUENCIES. See everything is energy. So I think theyve sprayed us with coronavirus influenza ebola what have you. Each disease can be activated by their resonant frequency which is transmitted by the 5g towers. 

I dont think 5g Gwens are always active at any full frequency at all. I think they activate to trigger the virus to come alive and run a low hum thats making us dizzy our ears ring light headed or feeling flu-ish fairly consistently.

Now theyre going to transmit through the 5g to either heal or kill the people but theyll make the masses believe 5g is a god. A healing tool. Like the rife machine can do. Heal the body by frequency. 

I feel we already are becoming ill by a low grade 5g frequency being emitted at an ongoing low threshold. But when they want to infect an area or town this is their ticket. 

Of all things we must ensure are dismantled are these towers. We are watching China and what is happening there is ALL 5G related and provoked. 

Im sure of it in my gut. I now must research my theory. 

Read below...

Raven Dutko White Dove ?

The highest level of court in China Supreme People’s Court is expected to give an approval on Friday for the mass killing of coronavirus patients in China as sure means of controlling the spread of the deadly virus.

The State tells the court that China is on the verge of losing its health workers to Coronavirus as at least 20 health workers contract the virus daily.

The State argues that coronavirus patients admitted at hospitals only have their deaths delayed and infect many others while receiving care at the hospital.

China has been under criticism for human rights violations and organizations have questioned China’s approach in dealing with the Coronavirus outbreak and it is believed the country has already killed many of its coronavirus patients.

The State mentioned in a document to the court that the country may lose its entire citizens if the few affected patients do not sacrifice their lives to save health workers and a billion others as there is no hope in sight in the fight against the virus.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it needs $1 billion to fight coronavirus outside China.

Countries around the world are starting to cut ties with China and pull their citizens out of the crisis-hit Hubei region where the virus emerged in the city of Wuhan.","1242867337_10221630620335144","tai.shofela"

Not that I necessarily agree entirely with this article but it goes into how a total society is organised and structured.

Then you can critically compare models. So to my mind the Chinese model is a legacy of the Soviet central command model which I am not in favour of. 

However if you could come up with some more democratic and open system of allocation of funds and resources that might be a viable socialism. Thence all the polarised arguments come into play about the “inevitability” of totalitarianism in a socialist or communist system. Whereas so far as I can see the private libertarian capitalist model would diminish private choice to the income levels of the individual - eg if your poor in the USA its quite likely you cant afford health care.

Towards the end of 2019 politician Zheng yongnians paper stating that China faces an era of intellectual deficiency has become widely read in China. Zheng seems to attribute Chinas intellectual recession to becoming a slave of money and power. Zheng questions the erosion of the Chinese governments freedom of learning and free speech. For example even in public forums and academic seminars hosted by universities and research institutes it is said that bureaucrats and the wealthy have played a central role and knowledge has become a shadowy ornament. Repression against the pursuit of knowledge and truth also leads to restraint on the Chinese economy. China needs to empower middle and middle-income people with political and social power to fully exploit the potential of innovation. Government orders do not create innovation. Creative societies need an educational process that encourages free questions and lively discussion. Freedom of the press and independence of the judiciary are also essential to protecting the rights of private companies and individuals. The Chinese government has been so busy with social oversight that it is too concerned about government taboos. Local governments seem to have been worried about the governments influence on pneumonia caused by a new type of coronavirus in Wuhan City Hubei Province. According to estimates by U.S. government broadcaster Radio Free Asia Chinas public security spending also known as the cost of maintaining stability in China exceeded national defense spending. Public security expenditures have reduced the resources available for more important economic issues. For Chinas growth it is better to treat the growing political and social aspirations of the middle class as resources for future change rather than as a threat to national stability.

In their hearts humans plan their course but the LORD establishes their steps.” Today’s Reflection: As much as we would love to preplan our future life has a subtle way of surprising us. As Jesus followers we firmly believe our lives are safely tucked in His protective embrace. Additionally we advocate He’s uniquely created us for a divine purpose. Therefore whatever you’re facing Jesus already knows and He’s enveloped you in His amazingly unadulterated love. My friends His sovereign omniscience designed a perfect blueprint for your life and He’s constructing you ... He’s training you ... He’s bringing you ... into a new dimension to miraculously perform great and mighty works. For this reason never give up and never be shaken. Eagerly embrace in the name of Jesus your Messiah Jeremiah 29:11 “For I know the plans I have for you” declares the LORD “plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future.” Praise the holy wonderful and precious name of Jesus. 29 LORD help me Jim all of us even our ENEMIES fear YOU WALK HUMBLY WITH YOU LOVING YOUR JUSTICE FAIRNESS AND MERCY 4 ALL GENERATIONS IMMEDIATELY AND PERMANENTLY AND RESPECT THOSE YOU HAVE CALLED ALL THE HELP AND HELPERS FROM YOU GOD WHETHER SPIRITUAL MENTAL EMOTIONAL PHYSICAL FINANCIAL PERSONAL SOCIAL INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGICAL OR LEGAL PLEASE AND THANK YOU FOR ALL I PRAY THIS PRAYER AND SURENDER TO YOUR MANIFESTED GLORY AND AUTHORITY ALONE PLEASE LORD AND ALSO ALL OTEVIOUSLY WRITTEN PLISTS HELP HELPERS FROM YOU CARES AND CONCERNS COUNT 2 PLEASE 292020 For my uncle clyde the wall in Israel all the requests and PRAYERLISTS there including Jim Jim Michael cara and family and the rest of us  February 9 GOD pdlmfwhfdca6ojcneteneewdYOUWMTDJDWUAMMYOUPLORD In agreement with Michael and Cara and their family and aish.com for them 2 please GOD 14 Heal me O LORD and I shall be healed save me and I shall be saved: for thou art my praise.GOD also praying about the ocean life and all effected by the earthquakes and all the OTHER disasterslocusts n bat plagues the coronavirus and other virus the attacks on the anti vaccination people etc happening around the world And extra prayer for Aiden snn djtjdcesLORDIPFHSP LORD I lift up the tropical storm damien GOD please PROTECT YOUR people help them GOD AND LORD LucwJgmwiiabouwahmpiraluarsweterwYOUAAHEL282020 Continued AGREEMENT in PRAYER that every evil plan and agendas against FROM time of conception and birth to now is CANCELLED off us all SPIRITUALLY MENTALLY EMOTIONALLY PHYSICALLY FINANCIALLY PERSONALLY SOCIALLY INDIVIDUALLY PSYCHOLOGICALLY and legally AND damage already done is undone healed dissolved.....and prevented PLEASE GOD EVERYONE we have prayed with for about all our help HELPERS FROM YOU LORD PAST PRESENT FUTURE 2 forever for all generations PRAYERLISTS FROM YOU GOD PRAYER TEAMS groups members all CHILDREN even in the womb pets HOMELESS and their homeless pets and or poor and their pets and all homeless animals GOD and the people that work FROM YOU GOD at the hospital and all hospitals stores convenience stores fastfood places truckers  Malls also all the VICTIMS from the earthquakes in California and Oregon 2day and or recently all responders from 911 INCLUDING Jim who was first crane in and ALL his and their spiritual mental EMOTIONAL PHYSICAL FINANCIAL PERSONAL SOCIAL INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND LEGAL HELP AND HELPERS FROM YOU GOD for him them and all these other disasters....

Fort heureusement les conditions de la maladie évoluent et les modes de propagation et de détection sont plus précis ce qui modifie des facteurs cruciaux que le programme ne prend pas en compte.

Cela signifie que nous sommes sans doute plus en sécurité que nous le pensons. Et le mot-clef ici c’est sans doute.

Car rationnelle ou non la peur du coronavirus se répand dans le monde entier. Aux États-Unis les habitants se jettent sur les masques à gaz. Au Canada où se trouve une grande communauté chinoise les masques chirurgicaux se vendent comme des petits pains. United Airlines Air France ainsi que d’autres compagnies aériennes ont annulé leurs vols vers la Chine et un bateau de croisière transportant des milliers de passagers est en quarantaine au large de l’Italie après la découverte d’un passager contaminé (le nombre de cas sur le bateau s’élève désormais à 10).

Un nouveau site internet qui suit en temps réel la propagation du coronavirus dans le monde entier indique que le nombre de cas attestés est aujourd’hui de 31 521 avec 639 décès et 1 607 guérisons. Toutes ces discussions ont poussé James Ross cofondateur de la start-up HedgeChatter à construire un programme permettant d’estimer la portée mondiale totale du coronavirus.

Il explique : « J’ai commencé par la propagation jour après jour en utilisant les chiffres publiés par les autorités chinoises. J’ai ensuite pris ces données et je les ai intégrées dans une IA qui fonctionne avec un réseau neuronal récurrent et j’ai lancé la simulation 10 millions de fois. Ce résultat correspondait aux prévisions du lendemain. Une fois ce chiffre édité je l’ai ajouté au jeu de données et j’ai relancé l’opération 10 millions de fois ».

Jusqu’à présent les résultats sont parvenus à prédire les chiffres du lendemain avec 3 % de marge d’erreur. Mais les résultats à long terme eux sont bien plus effrayants. Selon le programme le coronavirus pourrait contaminer 50 000 patients et faire 1 000 morts en une semaine puis 208 000 patients et 4 400 morts en deux semaines. Les chiffres augmentent rapidement car chaque patient contamine des personnes de son entourage. L’IA estime donc que 2 millions de personnes pourraient mourir des suites de la maladie en 30 jours. Mais haut les cœurs car tout n’est pas perdu.

Le programme ne connaît pas tous les facteurs du virus et ça James Ross le sait bien. Par ailleurs selon de nombreux professionnels de la santé la bonne nouvelle est que les conditions du coronavirus évoluent et que les données qui alimentent le programme devraient refléter ces changements. Ainsi les prévisions pourront être revues à la baisse.

Parmi ces évolutions la plus importante est sans doute le taux de mortalité. Le professeur Eyal Leshem du Sheba Medical Center en Israël explique : « Si une grande partie des personnes contaminées sont asymptomatiques ou présentent des symptômes légers ces patients peuvent ne pas être déclarés. Ainsi le nombre réel de cas en Chine est sans doute bien plus élevé que ce que l’on pense. Cela pourrait vouloir dire que le taux de mortalité (actuellement estimé à 2 % des personnes contaminées) pourrait être beaucoup plus faible ».

En d’autres termes un virus qui se propage plus largement ne semble pas être une bonne nouvelle à première vue mais en réalité cela peut faire baisser le taux de mortalité. Dès lors le coronavirus devient moins menaçant.

Le docteur Amesh Adalja chercheur principal au Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security (Baltimore) complète ces explications : « Le taux de mortalité baisse au fur et à mesure que nous comprenons que la majorité des cas ne sont pas graves. Une fois que des tests seront effectués sur des portions plus importantes de la population (et pas seulement sur les patients hospitalisés) nous verrons que l’ampleur de la maladie ne fait pas d’elle une pandémie grave ».

Brian Labus professeur assistant à l’école de santé publique de l’université du Nevada à Las Vegas compare le coronavirus à la grippe : « Le taux de mortalité constaté au début d’une épidémie est généralement gonflé car nous examinons d’abord les personnes les plus malades. Parmi elles beaucoup ne survivent pas ce qui donne une image faussée. Les prévisions du programme sont irréalistes. L’an dernier la grippe a contaminé environ 8 % de la population sur 7 à 8 mois tandis que selon l’IA un tiers de la population de la Terre aurait été touchée en 6 semaines ».

Tous ces facteurs ont des conséquences cruciales sur le taux d’infection et le taux de mortalité et même de petits change

26th Regular Session of the 19th City Council
? Cagayan de Oro City

____

Vice Mayor Kikang Uy presided the regular session earlier. 

Status report on the Cagayan de Oro River Banks Development was presented by the Engineers from DPWH R10 and City Housing and Urban Development Department (CHUDD). This project will cover the areas and barangays near the river as precaution for possible flooding in the future. This was started because of the devastation brought about by Typhoon Sendong last 2011. 
The project’s estimated time of completion is on year 2022. 

Also the DOH reported updates about their partnership with the City Health Office (CHO) regarding the information dissemination and precautionary measures concerning the 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
No confirmed cases to date in the City.

Cz??? sze??dziesi?ta szósta. Cz?owiek i jego pragnienie.
Pragnienie zrozumienia an?logii w projektowaniu terytorialnym.

The desire to understand the an?logies of territorial design as imposed on linear time. The Soviet Union was originally conceived formed and continued its short existence ... technically economically and structurally - as a Ford model but in the form of an ideologized state hyper monopoly. If you call a spade a spade then it should be said that by its collapse it turned into a zombie company supporting its existence on a “free” financial resource  Soviet economy officials in their “bird language” called it a drop in capital productivity  however like Ford in our time  ...
Actually the same Ford of the twenty-first century is financial instruments for maintaining obligations  the theoretical possibility of fulfilling them is not considered  lobbying instruments for self-sustaining design defense orders and technologies in a residual principle ... Ford now is an old zombie company for all that Respect to founder Henry Ford.
A little about the essence of time ... Coronavirus as a special operation in Wuhan. I must say right away that I do not agree with the statements - this is a kind of quasi-civil war. But in fact the coronavirus manifests itself as a cover for a social  transformation of the Celestial Empire’s hyper community which is quite “plausible”. Particular attention should be paid to the fact that the victims of coronavirus were patients older than fifty years and this is the age when people in the Middle Kingdom begin to take care of their vessels and energy channels in order to ensure free circulation of blood and qi energy. The macrocosm is like a microcosm and the vessels of people after fifty are the countrys irrigation systems and food security and the concern for the free circulation of qi in peoples energy channels is concern for the state of transport infrastructure and economic development. Metaphysically concern for a generation after fifty is a concern for economic prosperity and the opposite damage to the cardiovascular system in people after fifty their mental vulnerability and energy weakness  lack of money  is a natural financial economic and technological regression of this hyper community.
In my subjective opinion the lack of care and concern for the older generation gives rise to the natural self-destruction of the komniti and as an option self-destruction of territorial design.
 Returning to the “analogies” ... At that time the “cholera in Odessa” was essentially a special operation since the system was no longer able to provide self-maintenance of complicated infrastructure and obvious signs of collapse forced management to use crisis management tools. The city was cleaned and prettified by a pretty tarnished as “Black Sea pearl” but after some time the system as a whole naturally collapsed. But what about Odessa ... as already said “bloom and prosper” and if in essence then ... systematic projections come and go and in the information society all projections are short-lived. Well the City ... the city remains. In the postmodern era of the community the territorial community is like some kind of integrity like a hyper money making company. The community should be cost-effective and self-sufficient the city now manifests itself primarily as a system of self-preservation and self-survival of the community. And what about mega design ... For them the twenty-first century I emphasize a quick century these are not the best of times. Narrative. Enough to save the World just do not need to stop it from being structured self-improving and developing. Time for the development of territorial communities and komniti. They will soon “sprout” among themselves build their hierarchy and form their structure.
A person cannot change the past only “rewrite” naturally changing the future since everything appears in the final analysis or “what it all led to”.

This thing just solves too many of Chinas problems to easily believe that its accidental.

Im not saying Im sure its a manufactured mass killing... but I am saying that we have to look at history and recognize the possibilitity.

The Beijing Politburo killed millions of children (especially girls) in their one-child policy.  They killed tens of millions in the Cultural Revolution.  They killed tens of millions in the Great Leap Forward.

And other similar communistnazisocialist regimes have done the same again and again over the past hundred years whenever they felt they had more people than their socialist economic system could afford.  They thin the herd its what they do.

Today China is suffering from a couple of big problems:  they cant produce enough new jobs for everyone the rest of the world is onto their scam and starting to look for other low cost countries to shift production to and Hong Kong has been in revolt for almost a year.

A national health crisis that gives the government the ultimate justification to impose quarantines and explain mass deaths and to incinerate bodies so that nobody can demand autopsies to determine whether they died of a virus or of gunshot wounds must be awfully tempting to the godless statists of the Beijing Politburo.

Note - Im not saying the coronavirus is imaginary.  Of COURSE its a real virus with a high severity level.   But I am saying that we should question any report any data any numbers that come out of Beijing about it.   Theres too much of a chance that the ChiComs are using this as cover to accomplish some of their other ends too.

As a well-known ChiCom-friendly American politician has been known to say: Never let a good crisis go to waste.

The latest patient diagnosed had come into contact with a previously confirmed UK case and is being treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London chief medical officer for England Professor Chris Whitty said.The new case comes after another plane carrying British citizens evacuated from the coronavirus-hit city of Wuhan landed in Oxfordshire.

The flight with more than 200 people on board including some foreign nationals arrived at RAF Brize Norton shortly before 7.30am on Sunday.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was the second and final flight to be chartered by the Government and had British Government staff and military medics on board.

As the death toll in China from the virus rose to 811 Prof Whitty said: “A further patient has tested positive for novel coronavirus in England bringing the total number of cases in the UK to four.

“The new case is a known contact of a previously confirmed UK case and the virus was passed on in France.

“Experts at Public Health England continue to work hard tracing patient contacts from the UK cases. They successfully identified this individual and ensured the appropriate support was provided.

“The patient has been transferred to a specialist NHS centre at The Royal Free Hospital and we are now using robust infection control measures to prevent any possible further spread of the virus.

“The NHS is extremely well prepared to manage these cases and treat them and we are working quickly to identify any further contacts the patient has had.

“This patient followed NHS advice by self-isolating rather than going to A&E. For the latest advice visit gov.ukcoronavirus.”

The latest confirmed case comes not long after five Britons tested positive for coronavirus in France.

The four adults and a nine-year-old child were diagnosed after they came into contact with a British national who had recently returned from Singapore the French health ministry said.

The five British nationals who are not in a serious condition were staying in the Alpine resort area of Contamines-Montjoie near Mont Blanc.

French officials said the British national who was in Singapore returned on January 24 and stayed for four days in the area in eastern France before returning to England on January 28.

The five Britons whose diagnosis was confirmed as well as six compatriots with whom they had close contact were taken to hospitals on Friday night in Lyon Saint-Etienne and Grenoble.

The chalet where they were staying housed a British family that lives in Contamines and another British family who were on holiday.

The ill child lives in Contamines and attends a local school and took French classes at another local school regional officials told a news conference on Saturday.

It is understood the third case confirmed in the UK is a man who caught the illness in Singapore.

He is reported to be a middle-aged British man and is understood to be the first UK national to contract the disease.

He is thought to have been diagnosed in Brighton and was transferred to St Thomas’ Hospital in London where there is an infectious diseases unit on Thursday afternoon.

Two other patients who had recently travelled from China are being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary infectious diseases centre in Newcastle.
 
One is a student at the University of York while the other is a family member.

The death toll in China from the coronavirus – now at 811 – surpasses SARS fatalities in the 2002-2003 outbreak.

The fourth UK case was confirmed not long after a British man in Majorca tested positive for coronavirus.

His wife and two daughters tested negative the government in the Balearic Islands said.

The passengers on the charter flight have been taken to the Kents Hill Park hotel and conference centre in Milton Keynes Buckinghamshire where they will be quarantined for 14 days.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the repatriation flight had brought back 105 British nationals and family members as well as 95 European nationals and family members.

The ambulance service said the presence of the group in Milton Keynes would not present a risk to local people.

The first group of Britons who returned on a flight last month are continuing their quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital Merseyside.

Elsewhere British honeymooner Alan Steele who was transferred from the cruise liner Diamond Princess to hospital in Japan with coronavirus was said to be feeling well and in good spirits.

How to protect yourself from infection

What is the virus causing the illness in Wuhan?
It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city which also sold live and newly slaughtered animals.
Have there been other coronaviruses?
New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002 Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries causing global panic infecting more than 8000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human but has greater lethality killing 35% of about 2500 people who have been infected.
What are the symptoms caused by the Wuhan coronavirus?
The virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.

Is the virus being transmitted from one person to another?
China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission and there have been such transmissions elsewhere. As of 9 February there have been at least 800 deaths from the virus worldwide. Infections inside China stand at almost 37200 and global infections have passed 280 in 28 countries. The mortality rate is 2%.

Two members of one family have been confirmed to have the virus in the UK a third person was diagnosed with it in Brighton and a fourth is b

Each week opinion leaders from South Florida are invited to offer their thoughts in 100 words or less on events of the past week andor to look at the week(s) ahead addressing the issues impacting our residents.

The SF100 opinions from the Palm Beach County opinion leaders are offered below as well as selected Broward submissions.

The submissions from all opinion leaders can also be found at:

Ted Deutch member U.S. House of Representatives

Last week: President Trump missed an opportunity to unite the country in his State of the Union address. In a deeply partisan speech he didn’t mention the over 300 bipartisan bills passed by the House. He should have highlighted the ways Democrats and Republicans are working together on issues that matter to Americans. Like HR 3 a bipartisan bill to lower prescription drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries and all private insurance-holders. Or the bipartisan HR 8 to require universal background checks on all gun purchases. From climate change to infrastructure we must work together to achieve solutions to strengthen our nation.

Looking ahead: Friday marks two years since we lost 17 members of our community in the MSD tragedy. Our community was devastated and shaken by the reality of gun violence in our country. On Friday I’ll honor their memory by visiting first responders and participating in community projects bringing people together. In Washington we need to recognize gun violence as a public health crisis and confront this deadly threat to our nation. Just as we created a government agency to address car accidents and deaths I will introduce legislation to establish an agency to explore every possible way to reduce gun violence.

Lois Frankel member U.S. House of Representatives

Last week: This week the House passed the bipartisan Keeping Girls in School Act legislation I introduced with colleagues from both sides of the aisle to address and reduce barriers that keep girls around the world out of school. The House also passed legislation to prevent funding for war with Iran without congressional authorization and to repeal the 2002 authorization for use of military force against Iraq while ensuring our troops are still able to defend Americans if there is an imminent threat.

Looking ahead: On Tuesday Donald Trump turned his State of the Union speech into a campaign rally. The next day after refusing to hear witnesses Senate Republicans – with one exception – acquitted President Trump of impeachment charges. Over in the House Democrats continued to fight for the people. We passed legislation to defend and secure labor unions—the champions of American workers to provide disaster relief to Puerto Rico following the series of earthquakes that have struck the island and to protect Medicaid a program that provides for the health and well-being of American families.

Lori Berman member Florida Senate

Last week: Iowa caucus voters and the country were left frustrated by the many inaccuracies of the seemingly broken caucus system. It is still somewhat unclear what led to these inconsistencies and numbers that simply do not add up. While the Iowa caucuses are seen as a strong indicator and litmus test of how the country is feeling leading up to a presidential election the state’s demographics are not necessarily representative of our nation overall. Perhaps it is time for Iowa to rethink how they count votes or the Democratic Party might rethink letting them go first.

Looking ahead: Next Friday marks not only Valentine’s Day but also the 2nd anniversary of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting. At a time when our kids our learning to duck and cover before they learn division and chemistry it’s incumbent upon every legislator to find ways to further secure our schools. Recently I have co-sponsored Alyssa’s Law a measure that would require panic alarms systems in public schools. The bill was named after Alyssa Alhadeff a student-victim of the Parkland shooting. The day our state prioritizes gun safety over the gun lobby is the day our kids can finally enjoy their youth.

Robert Weinroth member Palm Beach County Commission

Last week: What is it about the demographics of Iowa that justifies its place at the head of the line when it comes to selecting delegates for the 2020 national conventions charged with selecting party nominees for President of the United States? That first in the nation status appears a bit precarious after the total meltdown of the tabulation of votes cast in the Democratic caucuses to apportion Iowa’s 29 delegates among the presidential hopefuls. With the candidates having moved onto New Hampshire Iowa has become virtually inconsequential. This disastrous result may finally eclipse Palm Beach County’s infamous “hanging chads” in 2000!

Looking ahead: As the state legislative session enters

Good morning this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 6 February.

Top stories
Hazard reduction burning had little to no effect in slowing severe fires that devastated more than 5m hectares across NSW this summer research from forest scientists has found. Scott Morrison told parliament on Wednesday that hazard reduction was at least as important as reducing greenhouse gas emissions in protecting Australians from future fires but given the size of fires prescribed burning did not “seem to have done much at all” the lead author Patrick Baker said. Meanwhile a group of 31 former fire and emergency bosses will write to the prime minister on Thursday arguing that any royal commission into the bushfires will be a waste of time and money if it fails to examine the role of climate change in exacerbating them.

A $165000 Liberal party donation from a close friend of Scott Morrison who is also vying for a $1bn government contract has been slammed by Labor as “fishy” with the party first confirming on Monday it had received the money – before the company director Scott Briggs and a Liberal spokesman both subsequently called that disclosure a mistake. A confidant of Morrison and former colleague of the immigration minister David Coleman Briggs heads a consortium that leads a bid to privatise Australia’s visa processing system. It’s not clear how the party came to accidentally declare the donation from a political consultancy business he founded. Labor’s Andrew Giles has called for a “full and proper explanation”.

The global death toll from the coronavirus is approaching 500 with a newborn baby diagnosed with the virus just 30 hours after birth the youngest of 24500 confirmed cases. In Australia there have been 14 confirmed cases. The home affairs minister Peter Dutton on Wednesday suggested Australians being evacuated from Wuhan could be sent to isolated mining camps should Christmas Island reach capacity. Near Japan thousands of people including up to 200 Australians face the next fortnight trapped on the luxury cruise ship the Diamond Princess after 10 passengers on board tested positive. The cruise company says two Australians are among the confirmed cases.

A landmark inquiry into potentially illegal strip searches conducted on minors by police in NSW has been cut short after the government sacked the commissioner responsible for overseeing the investigation.

The government has called for a national expansion of the cashless welfare card despite claims by Indigenous and welfare organisations that the program is discriminatory. Luke Henrique-Gomes answers key questions about the card while Nijole Naujokas explains how demeaning the experience can be for welfare recipients.

The Iowa Democratic party has released an incomplete tally from Tuesday’s bungled count that has Pete Buttigieg with a leading percentage of delegates with 26.8% ahead of Bernie Sanders (25.2%) Elizabeth Warren (18.4%) and Joe Biden (15.4%). Nearly 30% of the count remains to be confirmed.

More than half a million Syrians have fled Idlib province after weeks of aerial bombardment from Bashar al-Assad’s and Russian forces. Turkish troops have clashed with Syrian government fighters killing at least 20 amid fears of further escalations.

February 8 2020 - SHANGHAIBEIJING - China raised the death toll from its coronavirus outbreak to 811 on Sunday passing the number killed globally by the SARS epidemic as authorities made plans for millions of people returning to work after an extended Lunar New Year break.
Many of China’s usually teeming cities have almost become ghost towns during the past two weeks as Communist Party rulers ordered virtual lockdowns canceled flights closed factories and shut schools.

Even on Monday a large number of workplaces and schools will remain closed and many white-collar employees will work from home.

The scale of the potential hit to an economy that has been the engine of global growth in recent years has taken a toll on financial markets as shares slumped and investors switched into safe-havens such as gold bonds and the Japanese yen.

China’s cabinet said on Sunday it would coordinate with transport authorities to ensure the smooth return to work of employees in key industries such as food and medicines.

The State Council’s special coronavirus group also said workers should return in “batches” rather than all at once in order to reduce infection risks.

China’s ambassador to Britain described the newly identified virus as “the enemy of mankind” in an interview with BBC television on Sunday but added it “is controllable is preventable is curable”.

“At this moment is very difficult to predict when we are going to have an inflection point” Liu Xiaoming told the Andrew Marr Show. “We certainly hope it will come soon but the isolation and quarantine measures have been very effective.”

China’s National Health Commission recorded another 89 deaths on Saturday pushing the total well above the 774 who died from SARS or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 20022003.

Total confirmed coronavirus cases in China stood at 37198 commission data showed. New infections recorded the first drop since Feb. 1 falling back below 3000 to 2656 cases. Of those 2147 cases were in Hubei province the epicenter of the outbreak.

The virus has also spread to at least 27 countries and regions according to a Reuters count based on official reports infecting more than 330 people. Two deaths have been reported outside mainland China - both of Chinese nationals.

MISTRUST AND DISMAY

As millions of Chinese prepared to go back to work the public dismay and mistrust of official numbers was evident on Weibo China’s equivalent of Twitter.

“What’s even more frustrating is that these are only the ‘official’ data” said one user.

“Don’t say anything else. We all know we can’t purchase masks anywhere why are we still going back to work?” said a second.

“More than 20000 doctors and nurses around the country have been sent to Hubei but why are the numbers still rising?” asked a third.

Authorities had told businesses to tack up to 10 extra days on to holidays that had been due to finish at the end of January and some restrictions continued.

Beijing has blocked a plan by Apple Inc supplier Foxconn Technology Co Ltd to resume production in China from Monday the Nikkei business daily reported.

Gaming giant Tencent Holdings Ltd said on Sunday it had asked staff to continue working from home until Feb. 21.

Hebei province which surrounds Beijing will keep schools shut until March 1 the People’s Daily newspaper said. Several provinces have shut schools until the end of February.

GLOBAL ALARM

Among the latest deaths 81 were in Hubei.

An American hospitalized in the provincial capital Wuhan where the outbreak began became the first confirmed non-Chinese victim. The Washington Post identified him as Hong Ling a 53-year old geneticist who studied rare diseases at Berkeley.

Joseph Eisenberg professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan said it was too early to say whether the epidemic was peaking.

“Even if reported cases might be peaking we don’t know what is happening with unreported cases” he said.

Major cities and capitals announced new travel restrictions as concern over the spread of the virus increased.

Chinese-ruled Hong Kong introduced a two-week quarantine on Saturday for all people arriving from the mainland or who have been there during the previous 14 days. Malaysia expanded its ban on visitors from China.

France issued a new travel advisory for its citizens saying it did not recommend traveling to China unless there was an “imperative” reason. Italy asked children traveling from China to stay away from school for two weeks voluntarily.

The latest patients outside China include five British nationals staying in a mountain village in Haute-Savoie in the Alps French health officials said raising fears of further infections at a busy period in the ski season.

“Shortly after the first Canadian case of the new coronavirus was announced in January David Shao a healthcare worker from Winnipeg the capital of Manitoba province was taunted by colleagues to go home and stop spreading the virus. He was not sick he was however the only Chinese person in his workplace.

Shao came to Canada in 1989 from Shanghai China. He had never been to Wuhan. In fact he had not been abroad for more than a year. Unfortunately these comments were all too familiar to him. During the SARS outbreak in 2003 his colleagues also told him to stay away and go home.

Shaos experiences throughout these two outbreaks are a reality for many Chinese people in Canada and beyond. As with SARS the latest health epidemic is a reminder of the pervasive racism that deems Chinese populations to be inherently foreign unhygienic and carriers of disease. 

There have been countless social media posts labelling Chinese people dirty and unclean. A video of a Chinese woman eating bat soup allegedly in a Wuhan restaurant went viral and was accompanied by the claim that the outbreak started from such practices.
That the video was shot on the Pacific island of Palau that the dish is a local delicacy (not a Chinese one) and that the outbreak did not start from a bat soup did not seem to matter to those eagerly wanting to believe that Chinese people get sick because they eat revolting food.

But disease and bad hygiene have less to do with what is eaten and more to do with the condition in which the food is prepared. And that is often determined by bad policies and lack of control rather than the food preferences of an ethnic group.

Chinese people have faced perceptions of being unhygienic and dirty long before SARS and the coronavirus came along. As early as the 19th century Opium Wars the Chinese nation was referred to as the sick man of East Asia. This slur took a literal turn as Chinese migrants to North America came to be associated with poor hygiene and proneness to disease.

In the late 19th century in Canada it was not uncommon for white-owned restaurants to advertise that they did not employ Chinese workers. One such restaurant in the city of Victoria claimed the stomach of a person of refined tastes must revolt at the mere idea that his dinner has been cooked by a Chinaman shortly after replacing its Chinese cooks with Germans.

This perception of Chinese people as unhygienic was often drawn from bad living conditions in Chinatowns. In 1887 Vancouvers Chinatown was described by reporters as an eyesore to civilisation and pest-producing. In 1890 during a cholera scare in Vancouver the local press demanded that the government take action against that citys Chinatown.

Despite the lack of evidence that cholera had arisen from the neighbourhood the city council designated Chinatown an official entity in the medical health officer rounds and health committee reports a designation that placed the neighbourhood under closer scrutiny for by-law infractions. Other designated entities included sewerage scavenging sites slaughterhouses and pig ranches - none of which were residential.

Chinese people were indeed living in poor conditions but that was hardly their fault. Despite repeated petitions to improve infrastructure the local authorities had neglected the immigrant area for years seeing it as a low priority. As a result Chinatown was filled with garbage and manure as it lacked a sewage system while its residents lived in overcrowded spaces lacking ventilation.

It is because of government neglect that these communities experienced higher rates of contagious diseases including tuberculosis. Sewage was finally introduced in 1896 but overcrowding was not resolved. Instead the city authorities often resorted to the demolition of houses in Chinatown on the basis that they were dangerous to the health of the city leaving many Chinese workers homeless.

Today conditions in Chinatowns across Canada have markedly improved but the stigma has remained and the SARS and coronavirus outbreaks have just added more fuel to the fire.

The Lunar New Year is an especially busy time for Chinese businesses but this year because of news of the epidemic Chinese malls and restaurants across the country remained empty. The Federation of Chinese Canadians in the city of Markham Ontario has reported that some Chinese businesses have suffered losses of between 20 percent and 90 percent as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. During the 2003 SARS outbreak Torontos Chinatowns saw their revenues drop between 40 percent and 80 percent.

And while some of the most marginalised communities are suffering the financial consequences of the outbreak and public panic the Canadian authorities are not only doing little t

RÉUNION D’INFORMATION ET D’ÉCHANGE
NOUVEAU CORONAVIRUS (2019-nCoV)
Jeudi 6 février 2020 – 16h00
Résidence de France à Hô Chi Minh-Ville
 
 
Une cinquantaine de personnes a participé à cette réunion. Etaient notamment conviés les élus des Français le Dr Lagüe (Médecin-Chef du CMI) et le Dr. Jean-Marcel Guillon (Directeur de l’hôpital franco-vietnamien) les chefs d’îlots (dont le Dr. Daniel Philippides) les responsables et parents de nos 4 établissements scolaires les co-pilotes du Club Santé les présidents d’associations de français et de la Chambre de Commerce et d’Industrie.
 
Eléments introductifs (consul général) :
-          Il s’agit d’une réunion importante face à une anxiété compréhensible face également à une épidémie dans un grand pays proche et l’apparition de cas au Vietnam même 
-          vos questions et commentaires sont utiles pour nous 
-          nous comptons aussi sur vous pour informer nos compatriotes éviter les fausses rumeurs et apaiser les peurs irrationnelles (réseaux sociaux) et les demandes excessives.
 
 
ORDRE DU JOUR :
Point sur les informations connues concernant le Coronavirus 
Mesures recommandées par le Ministère de l’Europe et des Affaires Etrangères 
Mesures mises en place dans la circonscription 
Discussion.
 
 
Point de situation générale à notre connaissance
 
- Le virus :

Le type de virus est connu (cause rhume grippe modérée) mais la souche est nouvelle.

Symptômes les plus pertinents (à l’heure actuelle) : fièvre toux sèche difficulté respiratoire importante (se manifestant tôt car il s’agit d’une fibrose pulmonaire).

Selon l’OMS :

transmission estimée à 1:2 
incubation : moyenne 5 jours (2-14 jours) 
taux de mortalité : inférieur à 3%.Taux de mortalité plus élevé en Chine pour raisons encore inconnues  mais extrêmement bas ailleurs 
Profil à risque de complication : personnes âgées fumeurs ceux ayant des maladies chroniques surtout des hommes.

Diffusion au 6 février :

Chine : 28 276 personnes infectée  565 décès
Monde : des cas identifiés dans 28 pays 2 décès (Philippines Hong Kong)
Au Vietnam : 10 cas (tous en lien avec la région de Wuhan) 0 décès.

Il n’y a aucune raison de penser que les autorités vietnamiennes ne seraient pas transparentes sur les chiffres. Selon une étude de Harvard comparant les niveaux de déclaration de cas en regard des volumes d’échanges de trafic aérien avec Wuhan le Vietnam se situe exactement dans l’intervalle de confiance. Cette même étude indique en revanche de potentielles sous-évaluations du nombre de cas pour le Cambodge l’Indonésie et la Thaïlande.

 

A ce stade il n’y a pas lieu de s’inquiéter outre mesure sauf si la situation se dégradait. Par ailleurs la concomitance avec la grippe ou rhume saisonniers peut conduire à des suspicions erronées.

 
Recommandations en particulier des autorités françaises
 
OMS :
* Etat d’urgence sanitaire mondial (public Health Emergency Intl Concern)
* Pas de restrictions aux voyages à ce stade
* Action centrée sur la préparation et le renforcement des réponses locales
Autorités Vietnamiennes :
* Etat « d’épidémie » (déclinaison de décisions OMS) mais pas à ce stade d’état d’urgence sanitaire national
* Les mesures prises portent essentiellement sur :
contrôle des frontières (dont suspension des vols avec la Chine interdiction d’entrée pour les étrangers ayant séjourné récemment en Chine fermeture progressive des liaisons terrestres) 
organisation de la réponse médicale (liste des hôpitaux nationaux habilités à traiter les cas suspects et à les tester) 
report de la rentrée scolaire (à l’appréciation des autorités provinciales) jusqu’au 10 février initialement prolongé au 16 février concernant la région Ho Chi Minh-ville 
le service de la santé d’Ho Chi Minh-ville aurait annoncé le 502 l’annulation de tous les événements dans les lieux publics avec leurs autorisations révoquées 
information prévention communication (dont « lutte contre les fausses nouvelles ») 
la déclinaison concrète d’un certains nombres de « recommandations » doit être précisé :
port du masque « dans les lieux publics » 
mesures « d’auto-isolement » pour les personnes ayant récemment séjourné en Chine.
Autorités françaises :
NB : Les mesures sont prises après discussions interministérielles incluant en particulier le ministère français de la Santé et donc des spécialistes des maladies infectieuses. Elles sont proportionnées et adaptées.
* Décisions portent essentiellement sur la situation en Chine avec voyages déconseillés sauf raison impérative et rapatriement des ressortissants et étrangers bloqués dans le Hubei  Wu

In particular through structural and functional studies on coronavirus and host cell interactions we have nailed down the key portion of the virus that could serve as a critical target for antibodies and vaccine development. In addition we have already developed a vaccine candidate against MERS-CoV which has been proven safe and effective against MERS-CoV infection in experimental animals.”

Since the outbreak of Wuhan 2019-nCoV Tsinghua Prof. Zhang Linqi and his team have been working tirelessly to find a vaccine.

“We have been using several innovative technologies to ensure timely development of vaccine and at the same time to maintain safety and the highest efficacy. Some research institutes claimed that a vaccine for 2019-nCoV will be ready in about 40 days. But I think this is overly optimistic. Given the nature of vaccine development it would certainly need a longer period of time. Even with the most efficient mRNA technique it would require at least 2-3 months if not longer.”

Prof. Zhang says we should focus harder on work until we have a safe and effective vaccine. Given what we know about this virus we are confident and optimistic that we will be there soon.

Phnom Penh (FN) Feb. 9 – The European Union (EU) which might decide to partially suspend the preferential trade system EBA (Everything But Arms) from Cambodia considers that as a sanction being imposed on the Phnom Penh Government. But my view is the opposite. I think this decision will definitely offer Prime Minister Hun Sen a golden opportunity with «Special Gift». 

That Gift is tantamount to “Raising the Status of Prime Minister Hun Sen”. Why do I dare to make such a firm assertion? There are a number of possible logical reasons that could prove it:

First of all it is worth noting that when currently the EBA is fully effective the EU may still have the pride to speak out or demand this or suggest that from Prime Minister Hun Sen-led- Government. However when the EBA is partially suspended though not wholly the EU will no longer be able to exert any influence on the Cambodian Government. And if I put this assertion in terms of football rule such suspension of EBA is tantamount to allowing Prime Minister Hun Sen a Five Free Kick Penalty without Goalkeeper. So what are the five free kicks that Prime Minister receives from the European Union?

First: Prime Minister Hun Sen has every logical reasons to explain to the local people about the EU unfair act of using a double standard regarding the value of democracy and human rights. The reason is that the EU which has always used democracy and human rights as the core value of its international relations has suspended the EBA from Cambodia while at the same time has signed a free trade agreement with Communist Vietnam. And on this point everyone could clearly understand what and how the EU is behaving. In the same vein the Hun Sen Government will also have another main nationalistic reason relating to the importance of defending the national sovereignty in order to win the heart and mind from Khmer people to continuously lend their stronger support for the ruling party because the words democracy and human rights which the western world keeps mentioning are nothing but only as an excuse to exploit small countries and especially as a shield to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.

Second: This EU decision will further aggravate the poor relationship between ASEAN and European Union Bloc because the latter must bear in mind that «Before reaching any agreement with EU ASEAN needs a Consensus. » However currently more than 50% of ASEAN member states are dissatisfied and in dispute with the EU. Those countries include Malaysia and Indonesia over palm oil issue the Philippines over human rights issues due to the Duterte’s anti-drug campaign and Burma over the Rohingya case and etc. Now the European Union has provoked another problem with Cambodia which will further deteriorate the ASEAN-EU relations.

Third: On local politics the Phnom Penh Government will enjoy the full liberty to enforce the rule of law at least on three important cases: the fate of opposition party in Cambodia the case of pro-opposition civil society and media that have committed illegal acts and abused the law and specially the decision on whether to request The Majesty The King or not to give pardon to Kem Sokha after the closure of his national treason case’s trial. Moreover the Cambodian Government would definitely be able to strengthen the law enforcement against illegal strikes and demonstrations anti-fake news restriction on Lese Majeste racial discrimination and foreign conspiracy etc…. And all these matters are the absolute rights to self-determination of the Cambodian Government particularly it lies in the full discretion of Prime Minister Hun Sen which no foreigners could again play the role as mediator or could intervene like what they used to do before the EBA suspension.

Fourth: Prime Minister Hun Sen-led-Government will use this opportunity of EBA suspension to « Put the House in order and Clear the Mess by strengthening the rule of law» so as to ensure its political and economic independence. In this sense the Phnom Penh Government will definitely strive to build up good governance improve social justice as well as combat corruption etc… by continuously «embarking upon the road of democracy but with Cambodian Special Characteristics » meaning that the EBA suspension becomes a driving force to push forward both the local reform and the momentum of Cambodian economy.

Most importantly based on the extensive and practical experiences learnt over the past 41 years of the Cambodian People’s Party particularly Mr. Hun Sen in successfully ruling and leading the country to overcome all challenges and obstacles such as the international political and economic blockade right after the country’s liberation in 1979 then the two waves of world economic and financial crisis that impacted in 1997 and 2008 etc… coupled with the tw

Anti-Asian hate the new outbreak threatening the world
asia.nikkei.com | February 8 2020 07:02 AM

NEW YORKPALO ALTO U.S. -- The deadly coronavirus outbreak in China has fueled an upsurge in anti-Asian discrimination hate speech and even violence elsewhere in the world much of it reaching a global audience on social media.

A shocking video posted to Twitter on Tuesday shows a man attacking a mask-wearing Asian woman at a Manhattan subway station while cursing at her and shouting Dont touch me! The man called her diseased according to Tony He a New York resident who posted the video.

What people are forgetting is that many Asians wore face masks way before the coronavirus trend He wrote adding that it has taken a crisis just for people to notice them.

Incidents involving Asians never go viral he lamented. People think were so docile and timid and that nothing ever happens to us. So if and when they do they get swept under the rug.

Canada generally seen as more welcoming toward immigrants than its southern neighbor has not been immune from virus-driven discrimination. An online petition in late January called for a school district in a Toronto suburb with a large Chinese population to keep students whose families had recently visited China out of school for more than two weeks.

The petition received about 10000 signatures but was rejected by the school board. Individuals who make assumptions even with positive intentions of safety about the risk of others and request or demand quarantine can be seen as demonstrating bias and racism the board said in a statement.

There have also been reports of bullying of Asian students and a review of a Chinese restaurant in Toronto received a flood of racist comments on social media.

Asian people have related stories of being blatantly avoided in public in France where Europes first confirmed coronavirus case emerged.

People are insulted and kicked off public transit because they are Asian. Its not just jokeshatred on social media French journalist Linh-Lan Dao wrote on Twitter. Dao also posted a thread on Twitter decrying racist media coverage of the outbreak including use of the term yellow peril.

The targets are not only of Chinese descent. An Instagram post by French luxury brand Louis Vuitton featuring a Japanese actress received a number of coronavirus comments. The brand took nearly a week to delete the problematic responses fueling a firestorm of online criticism.

An individual identified only as Ms. Chen 25 from Beijing is a graduate student at UCLA. She and a friend were asked to leave a restaurant in the West Hollywood section of Los Angeles this week because her friend was coughing.

The crazy part is my friend is not even Chinese she is Vietnamese and has never been to China Chen told the Nikkei Asian Review.

In an article on anti-Asian bigotry in France Le Parisien newspaper quoted a Twitter user who said they would not sit next to someone Asian -- even if they did not know if the person was from Wuhan or Seoul.

Another Twitter user posted a photo of a sign in a bar near Trevi Fountain Rome on Jan. 31 which reads Due to international safety measures all people coming from China are not allowed to have access in this place. We do apologize for any inconvenient.

Discrimination against Chinese has manifested even in Asia. The New York Times reported last week that a hashtag translating to ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Japanese Twitter.

At a time when Chinas rise as a global economic and military power has unsettled its neighbors in Asia as well as its rivals in the West the coronavirus is feeding into latent bigotry against the people of mainland China the newspaper wrote.

A man from Shanghai who only gave his surname Ma was on the last day of a ski trip with his Korean wife in Yongpyong South Korea. The couple booked a sea-view suite in a hot spring resort in a nearby city. After a long day of skiing on Feb. 1 the couple drove 45 mins to the resort only to be told by the front desk that they couldnt be checked in. The reason he clerk gave Ma said was because he was Chinese and it would cause an inconvenience to other guests.

Despite Ma showing evidence that they have left China 10 days ago and show no symptoms the hotel turned them down. Ma complained about his experience in Weibo and comments on the post shows at least four other Chinese tourists had similar experience in Korea.

In France the hashtag JeNeSuisPasUnVirus or I am not a virus is being used to call for an end to coronavirus-related discrimination.

There is still a great deal of work to do to raise awareness Ya-Han Chuang of Frances National Institute for Demographic Studies said in an interview with Euronews. Chu

This is in line with the recommendations of the Department of Health (DOH) as affirmed by members of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases. 

Taking into consideration the concerns raised by key government officials and health experts the President made an informed decision and has agreed to adopt this recommendation and implement it immediately as additional precautionary measure to protect Filipinos and everyone in the Philippines. 

I wish to emphasize that we are not singling out Chinese nationals. This order covers all travelers from China to the Philippines regardless of nationality. We empathize with China given what they are going through but we are doing this to protect the country and its people. The Philippine government is committed to help China and other affected countries address this worldwide health concern. 

I am urging the public to be informed and listen to our officials and health experts. Do not panic. Magtulungan tayo. Unahin natin ang kapakanan interes at kalusugan ng bawat Pilipino.  

Para klaro po sa publiko maglalabas ng mga detalye ang Office of the President para ipaliwanag ang sakop ng rekomendasyon na ito.

The pangolin may be an intermediate host for the novel coronavirus given that the genome sequence of a virus strain taken from the animal was up to 99 percent identical to that of the virus that attacks humans a study has found. 
Intermediate hosts can serve as a bridge between the source of the virus and a host such as humans.
The study jointly conducted by researchers from South China Agricultural University and other scientific research institutes may be of great significance to the prevention and control of the virus outbreak which had caused 31261 confirmed infections on the Chinese mainland as of late Friday.
The study’s results announced on Friday at a news conference held by the university and the Guangdong Provincial Lab of Lingnan Modern Agricultural Sciences and Technology included analyses of more than 1000 samples from wild animals.
It pointed to pangolins a type of scaly anteater as the most likely intermediate host officials said.
Through molecular biological testing it revealed that the pangolins in the study tested positive at a rate of 70 percent for a type of coronavirus that includes the novel coronavirus.
Electron microscopy shows a typical coronavirus particle structure in pangolins according to the study. Researchers who analyzed the virus genome found the sequence between the isolated virus strain and the human strain involved in the outbreak was up to 99 percent identical.
“We hope the study will be helpful for scientific prevention and control of the disease as well as providing references for further scientific research of the novel coronavirus” said Liu Yahong president of South China Agricultural University.
Liu also said scientists think the study may “offer a scientific basis for policies related to the control and protection of wild animals”. Liu also is executive deputy director of the Guangdong Provincial Lab of Lingnan Modern Agricultural Sciences and Technology.
Zeng Guang chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said more scientific studies need to be done into the exact transmission route of the viruses infecting animals and humans.
“Trade and consumption of wild animals of all kinds should be banned. Otherwise people will suffer” Zeng said.
Shen Yongyi a professor at South China Agricultural University said there might be more than one intermediate host of the novel coronavirus.","355056141837726_479656269377712","CPRDC"

Moi: je pensais que tu étais de son côté
 
Elle : je suis du côté de ton bonheur jamais au grand jamais je ne serai du côté d’une autre personne que toi on peut se battre entre nous et dieu est témoin de nos disputes mais je te choisirai toujours toi ! Et tu sais pourquoi Kara parce que c’est toi et moi contre le monde
 
Moi: je l’aime toujours et sortir avec lui ce soir c’est manquer de respect à sa fiancée c’est accepter de ressentir ce que je m’échine à repousser depuis deux ans tu as vu dans quel état j’étais
 
Elle : est-ce que sa fiancée c’est ta sœur ? Ta cousine ? Ton amie? Ta mère ?
 
Moi: non...

President Trumps proposed this years 2020 budget would cut:

SOCIAL SECURITY
MEDICARE (CUT Hundreds of billions of $ over 10 yrs)
MEDICAID (CUT $920 billion over 10 yrs)

Just to name the major few that will affect everyday Americans -- most affecting the elderly the poor & the sick.
____________________
E.P.A. - CUT 26.5%
Health & Human Services - 9%

    - (while the coronavirus spreads)
State Dept. - 22%

Interior Dept. - 13.4%
Housing & Urban Development - 15.2%

ADDITIONALLY: Cutting FOOD STAMPS by $181000000000 ($181 Billion USD.) over a decade.
(Because why not take food from the poor right?)

THANKS TRUMP.
Keep in mind the reason our country is going into debt right now is because of the Trump Tax Cut & Jobs Act of 2017. 
You know the one --  the one that cut taxes for the top 1% & corporations. 
The one that Amazon paid $0 in taxes
The one that General Motors paid $0 in taxes
The one that Netlfix paid $0 in taxes
The one that Starbucks paid $0 in taxes

All across China people are talking about Dr Li Wen Liang. He was the doctor who discovered the novel coronavirus and in the early morning of 7 Feb 2.58am he was promoted into glory and went home to be with our Father in heaven. 

Back in December last year he was arrested for being a whistle blower spreading rumors about a mysterious pneumonia like virus. This morning we found out he was infact a fellow brother in Christ. Our hearts are deeply moved by his sacrificial choice to spread awareness about the virus despite the risks he faced especially to his reputation and to his own health. 
He continued to care for patients up until he was infected himself. What a legacy to leave behind of what it means to be like Jesus to those hurting in a time of crisis. 
He chose to be an example of Immanuel God with us to the people of Wuhan. 
Can you imagine the joy he must have felt as he entered into eternity and heard the words Well done my good and faithful servant? 

So today please pray for his family especially his wife who is also infected and 8 months pregnant with their second child. May God heal them supernaturally n give them grace peace strength and comfort during this time.

Dr Li Wen Liang penned a deeply touching Chinese poem below of how he would miss his family his beloved Wuhan n quoted 2 Tim 4:7-8 I have fought the good fight I have finished the race I have kept the faith. Finally there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous Judge will give to me on that Day and not to me only but also to all who have loved His appearing.

The Hero Who Told The Truth

Here is a captivating heart-touching Chinese poem Ive tried to translate into English. It was written in memory of Mr Li Wenliang a Christian doctor and whistleblower who died from the coronavirus himself after being punished for issuing the first warning about the deadly coronavirus outbreak.

I dont want to be a hero.
I still have my parents
And my children
And my pregnant wife whos about to give birth
And many of my patients in the ward.
Though my integrity cannot be exchanged for the goodness of others
Despite my loss and confusion
I should proceed anyway.
Who let me choose this country and this family?
How many grievances do I have?
When this battle is over
I will look up to the sky
With tears like rain.

I dont want to be a hero.
But as a doctor
I cannot just see this unknown virus
Hurting my peers
And so many innocent people.
Though they are dying
They are always looking at me in their eyes
With their hope of life.

“Who would have ever realised that I was going to die?

Where are my parents?
And my dear wife
The lady I once had a hard time chasing?

There is a light in the sky!
At the end of that light is the heaven that people often talk about.
But Id rather not go there.
Id rather go back to my hometown in Wuhan.
I have my new house there
For which I still have to pay off the loan every month.
How can I give up?
How can I give up?
For my parents without their son
How sad must it be?
For my sweetheart without her husband 
How can she face the vicissitudes in her future?

.
China tengah mengembangkan berbagai obat untuk virus corona. Salah satu yang diyakini bisa menyembuhkan pasien virus corona adalah Remdesivir.
.
Dilansir South China Morning Post (SCMP) (6022020) China telah mengajukan permohonan untuk mematenkan obat tersebut.
.
Jurnal Cell Research mencatat penelitian telah dilakukan di luar tubuh manusia dan menemukan bahwa senyawa remilei Gilead dan obat malaria kloroquine sangat efektif dalam pengendalian infeksi virus corona.
.
Remdesivir pada awalnya dikembangkan oleh Gilead Sciences yang berbasis di AS untuk mengobati Ebola.
.
Lalu diujikan kembali untuk mengobati pasien virus corona baru. Pasien coronavirus pertama di AS diketahui membaik setelah diobati dengan Remdesivir.
.
Hal itu diungkapkan oleh dokter yang menangani pasien tersebut dalam sebuah jurnal yang diterbitkan The New England Journal of Medicine pada pekan lalu.
.
Gilead Sciences telah setuju dan mendukung Kementerian Kesehatan China untuk melakukan uji klinis.
.
Saat ini obat eksperimental Remdesivir makin dekat untuk disetujui sebagai pengobatan.
.
Eksperimen tahap tiga dimulai di Wuhan pada Kamis (6022020) dipimpin oleh tim dari Rumah Sakit Persahabatan China-Jepang dan Rumah Sakit Jinyintan Wuhan.
.
Uji coba akan melibatkan 761 pasien terdiri atas 308 orang dengan gejala ringan dan 453 orang dalam kondisi serius.

He was the doctor who discovered the novel coronavirus and in the early morning of 7 Feb 2.58am he was promoted into glory and went home to be with our Father in heaven. 

Back in December last year he was arrested for being a whistle blower spreading rumors about a mysterious pneumonia like virus. This morning we found out he was infact a fellow brother in Christ. Our hearts are deeply moved by his sacrificial choice to spread awareness about the virus despite the risks he faced especially to his reputation and to his own health. 
He continued to care for patients up until he was infected himself. What a legacy to leave behind of what it means to be like Jesus to those hurting in a time of crisis. 
He chose to be an example of Immanuel God with us to the people of Wuhan. 
Can you imagine the joy he must have felt as he entered into eternity and heard the words Well done my good and faithful servant? 

So today please pray for his family especially his wife who is also infected and 8 months pregnant with their second child. May God heal them supernaturally n give them grace peace strength and comfort during this time.

Dr Li Wen Liang penned a deeply touching Chinese poem below of how he would miss his family his beloved Wuhan n quoted 2 Tim 4:7-8 I have fought the good fight I have finished the race I have kept the faith. Finally there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous Judge will give to me on that Day and not to me only but also to all who have loved His appearing.

The Hero Who Told The Truth

Here is a captivating heart-touching Chinese poem Ive tried to translate into English. It was written in memory of Mr Li Wenliang a Christian doctor and whistleblower who died from the coronavirus himself after being punished for issuing the first warning about the deadly coronavirus outbreak.

I dont want to be a hero.
I still have my parents
And my children
And my pregnant wife whos about to give birth
And many of my patients in the ward.
Though my integrity cannot be exchanged for the goodness of others
Despite my loss and confusion
I should proceed anyway.
Who let me choose this country and this family?
How many grievances do I have?
When this battle is over
I will look up to the sky
With tears like rain.

I dont want to be a hero.
But as a doctor
I cannot just see this unknown virus
Hurting my peers
And so many innocent people.
Though they are dying
They are always looking at me in their eyes
With their hope of life.

“Who would have ever realised that I was going to die?

And my dear wife

There is a light in the sky!
At the end of that light is the heaven that people often talk about.
But Id rather not go there.
Id rather go back to my hometown in Wuhan.
I have my new house there
For which I still have to pay off the loan every month.
How can I give up?
How can I give up?
For my parents without their son
How sad must it be?
For my sweetheart without her husband 
How can she face the vicissitudes in her future?

Using estimates of underlying infection prevalence in Wuhan at the end of January derived from testing of passengers on repatriation flights to Japan and Germany we adjusted the estimates of CFR from either the early epidemic in Hubei Province or from cases reported outside mainland China to obtain estimates of the overall CFR in all infections (asymptomatic or symptomatic) of approximately 1% (95% confidence interval 0.5%-4%). It is important to note that the differences in these estimates does not reflect underlying differences in disease severity between countries. CFRs seen in individual countries will vary depending on the sensitivity of different surveillance systems to detect cases of differing levels of severity and the clinical care offered to severely ill cases. All CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously at the current time as the sensitivity of surveillance of both deaths and cases in mainland China is unclear. Furthermore all estimates rely on limited data on the typical time intervals from symptom onset to death or recovery which influences the CFR estimates.

11022020
BY GRACE AUKA-SALMANG

A total of 6000 people so far have been screened for the coronavirus since January 23 says Acting Health Secretary Dr Paison Dakulala.
For travellers from China he said he was unsure of how many people were screened.
“110 persons were of interest due to their travel history and three people with travel history investigated and samples have been collected and sent to the lab for verification” he said.
“This needs to be followed up and this is where funding will be needed.
“The certified laboratory for such testing to be done is the PNG Institute of Medical Research (IMR).”
World Health Organisation (WHO) country representative Dr Luo Dapeng said the coronavirus was a new virus and the development of the vaccines for this virus was a challenge for scientists at the moment.
“WHO are now calling on global scientists to work out the vaccines but it will take time we don’t know when this will be developed as it is different from other pandemic influenza outbreaks” he said.
“There is no specific medicine to cure this disease.”
Dr Dakulala said the rapid response team consisting of trained surveillance officers was working to follow up on persons under investigation who are at risk due to travel history.
He said the department’s issue was the capacity of the health workers that needed to be stepped up should PNG got into the situation where the virus hits PNG in a big way.
“Currently there are more than 10 people who are working on a shift at the airport site to screen incoming passengers from overseas” Dr Dakulala said.
“We are trying to ensure that there is adequate numbers to enable that so workers don’t have to miss out on any flights because the coordination of that has been an issue.
“We are planning to step up in this area to ensure none of the planes that come in are missed out and the screening process is done in the best way they can.”
He said the help desk at the airports as well as sea ports was facing the same issue. Dr Dakulala said there were three main ports that were screening and they were Motukea Lae and Rabaul.
“All the provinces have asked to mount their response in the stepping up process in case PNG has a case Provincial Health Authorities (PHA’s) also step up their response too” he said.","100007984748869_VK_1536163659866526","rimurepa.ririyahala"

Under Chinese law force majeure -- or act of God -- provisions are usually declared in the event of war natural disaster or intervention by state authorities. Commercial contracts generally contain such clauses and if those conditions are met a company is exempt from delivering goods or paying invoices among other previously agreed-upon obligations.

When the coronavirus epidemic went into high gear at the end of last month the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade started to issue force majeure certificates recognizing the outbreak as a triggering event.

The certificates themselves are not free passes but they can be used during negotiation between relevant parties said Masanori Kawai an attorney for the Tokyo-based law firm Nagashima Ohno & Tsunematsu.

When an enterprise declares it cannot fulfill contractual obligations under force majeure provisions the parties involved will first attempt to negotiate a settlement. Failing that the dispute moves to legal proceedings such as a court or an arbitration panel.

In the wake of the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 Chinese courts lowered breach-of-contract fees by more than two-thirds. This time around it is widely believed that the courts will generally side with domestic companies hit by the coronavirus.

Auto parts maker Huzhou Huida Machinery Manufacturing faces delays on deliveries to clients in Africa because local governments back home extended the official Lunar New Year holiday to at least Feb. 9 from the originally planned end date of Jan. 30.

With the lack of deliveries handicapping operations at client facilities Huida could be asked to pay about 30 million yuan ($4.3 million) in damages. The company successfully applied for a force majeure certificate from the trade council and the parts maker will negotiate smaller remuneration with client companies.

By issuing the certificates the trade council will try our best to protect such enterprises by reducing their economic losses to the minimum said Ding Guming director of legal affairs with the Huzhou branch.

Some Japanese corporations appear to have encountered force majeure actions by their Chinese business partners. Liuzhou Glory Zinc Minmetchem received a certificate as it encounters delays in delivering goods to a Japanese chemical trader.

Production lines are not operational as of Monday said a Glory Zinc representative. Deliveries are likely to be made in March.

At least 97 Chinese enterprises had received force majeure certificates from the council as of Monday. The industries cut across a wide spectrum including steel apparel paper products and construction materials.

The list apparently includes the Chinese arms of foreign multinationals as well. With the list expected to grow much longer the force majeure proceedings will spread to more Japanese companies.

Major Chinese groups are also invoking force majeure protections. CNOOC has cited the coronavirus as the reason to put off contractually obligated purchases of liquefied natural gas according to state media reports.

A state-owned shipbuilder has apparently declared force majeure as well to renegotiate delivery times for vessels with the move due in part to difficulty securing manpower.

Chinese authorities are scrambling to put together a package that will ease the impact of the coronavirus on the business sector and economy at large. The Peoples Bank of China the nations central bank hinted at a rate cut this month and is instructing banks against cutting back or recalling loans. Regional governments are likely to step up infrastructure investments.

Considering the force majeure certificates are part of the overall initiative to alleviate the outbreaks repercussions state actions and court judgments may tend to favor Chinese enterprises. International companies doing business in China could be pressed to make concessions on delivery dates and breach-of-contract penalties.","100000258395481_3007770805908170","duong.le.982"

But wait read this...

China is using AbbVie Inc’s HIV drugs as an ad-hoc treatment for pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus while the global search for a cure continues.

The Beijing branch of China’s National Health Commission said that a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir sold under the brand name Kaletra by AbbVie is part of its latest treatment plan for patients infected by the virus which has killed at least 56 people in China and sickened more than 2000 worldwide.

The NHC said that while there is not yet any effective anti-viral drug it recommends patients are given two lopinavir and ritonavir tablets twice a day and a dose of alpha-interpheron through nebulization twice daily.

 Treatment Plan for New Virus
Medical journal Lancet said on Friday that a clinical trial is under way using ritonavir and lopinavir to treat cases of the new coronavirus. Meanwhile China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention will start developing a vaccine according to the Global Times.

Wang Guangfa a respiratory expert at Peking University First Hospital in Beijing who was infected by the virus after visiting Wuhan to inspect to coronavirus patients told China News Week earlier this week that his doctor recommended he take the HIV drugs to fight the new virus and they worked on him.","100000748573056_3020109771357279","rickee.lee.9"

Dr. Gregory Poland professor of medicine and infectious diseases and the director of the Vaccine Research Group at Mayo Clinic and Dr. Scott Gottlieb Pfizer board member and former FDA Commissioner join Squawk Box to discuss the spread of misinformation on the coronavirus.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned on Monday that the world may be “dangerously” unprepared for the next pandemic as the flu-like coronavirus that emerged from China about a month ago spreads rapidly to new countries.

At an executive board meeting in Geneva Tedros urged the World Health Organization’s 196 member countries to “invest in preparedness” not “panic.” He added that funding for outbreak preparedness in surrounding countries “has remained grossly inadequate” in the past.

“For too long the world has operated on a cycle of panic and neglect” Tedros said according to a transcript of his remarks. “We throw money at an outbreak and when it’s over we forget about it and do nothing to prevent the next one.”

“If we fail to prepare we are preparing to fail” he added.

Tedros said more than $1 billion has been spent trying to stop the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. By comparison he added just $18 million was spent on preparedness in Congo’s neighbor Uganda before the virus crossed the border.

“This must be a lesson for the rest of the world” he said.

The plea from WHO’s top official comes as the deadly coronavirus has now killed at least 362 people and sickened more than 17400 worldwide including patients in the U.S. and Europe.

The respiratory illness which is capable of spreading through human-to-human contact is not yet considered a pandemic. A pandemic is “an epidemic occurring worldwide or over a very wide area crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people” according to WHO. While the new virus has spread to almost two dozen countries the majority of the cases remain in mainland China.

Nevertheless many global health experts expect the virus will become a pandemic. Since emerging about a month ago in Wuhan China the coronavirus has infected more people than the 2003 SARS epidemic which sickened roughly 8100 people across the globe over nine months. As of Monday there are nearly 200 cases in at least 23 countries outside of China a handful of which have been transmitted from human contact within those countries.

On Thursday WHO declared the virus a global health emergency after declining to do so at two previous meetings.

Tedros said the “continued increase in cases and the evidence of human-to-human transmission outside of China” were “most deeply disturbing.”

Men women and children arrived at the 300-bed hotel facility at 10.15am on Sunday February 9 in eight coaches. All guests underwent additional health screening immediately on arrival. Additional clothing toiletries children’s toys nappies and other comfort items were made available for all guests. Each guest (or couple family group) have been allocated two rooms (one as a bedroom and one as lounge kitchen) where they will remain in isolation for the next 48 hours. Fridges and microwaves are available in every room along with food and drinks.

Staff from a number of different health and social care agencies including Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS England South Central Ambulance Service Milton Keynes CCG and Public Health England as well Milton Keynes Council are providing on-site support for guests at the facility.

All guests and staff are adhering to strict infection and prevention control protocols including wearing masks and gloves. Staff in close contact with guests or performing clinical assessments are wearing full personal protective equipment.

Access to the hotel facility is strictly regulated and staff leaving the facility undertake appropriate decontamination. As guests remain in isolation – as a precautionary measure – and with controls on access and rigorous infection prevention and control measures in place there is no risk to the wider public.

The presence of this group in Milton Keynes does not present any risk to local people – businesses and schools on the Kents Hill Park estate will continue to open as normal. No additional safeguards are required for members of the public.

The process of repatriation has been led by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office with the advice of the Chief Medical Officer and the support of the Department of Health and Social Care the NHS and Public Health England.

The UK is well prepared for these types of incidents and there is rapid and effective testing undertaken by PHE available for this virus. The NHS has expert teams of highly-trained staff and specialist hospital units around the country ready to receive and care for any patients with any highly infectious disease. The NHS adheres to the highest safety standards for the protection of its staff patients and the public.

Based on current evidence Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) presents with flu-like symptoms including a fever a cough or difficulty breathing. The current evidence is that most cases appear to be mild.

Déclaration liminaire

Bonjour Mesdames et messieurs les journalistes et merci d’avoir honoré de votre présence ce point de presse ! 
Nous sommes au 407ème jour du massacre de Yirgou. L’Opposition politique continue de réclamer justice pour le Chef de Yirgou ses proches et les 210 Peuls tués dans cette barbarie inqualifiable. L’Opposition dénonce également l’ethnicisme qui remet en cause notre unité en tant que nation.
Aujourd’hui nous vous proposons comme sujets :
- la dégradation de la situation sécuritaire 
-les élections de Novembre 2020
- l’enrôlement des électeurs de l’intérieur  
- le Coronavirus
- et les cérémonies pompeuses de lancements de travaux.

Mesdames et Messieurs les journalistes 
Plus un jour ne passe sans que le sang des Burkinabè ne coule. La situation sécuritaire s’est sérieusement dégradée. Nos populations civiles sont victimes de massacres de menaces et de famine. En effet l’Opposition politique note avec une grande désolation que les attaques de marchés et de lieux de cultes de même que les tueries de masse deviennent de plus en plus le mode opératoire des ennemis du Burkina Faso.
L’Opposition demande à nouveau au Gouvernement de tout mettre en œuvre pour minimiser les pertes en vies humaines en sécurisant les populations et leurs biens. Cela passe par l’anticipation et la réactivité.
Car le plus souvent des alertes sont données et des ultimatums lancés aux populations avant les massacres.
Nous ne cesserons de le dire le problème ne vient pas de nos braves FDS. Elles qui nuit et jour se battent pour défendre avec dignité la terre de nos ancêtres. La preuve est que hier lundi huit assaillants ont été neutralisés et un autre capturé ans l’attaque contre le poste de gendarmerie de Tanwalbougou dans la province du Gourma. 
Nos FDS sont donc professionnels courageux et combatifs. Si le Burkina est encore débout c’est grâce à leur patriotisme. Le problème disions-nous vient du manque de leadership et de vision des dirigeants politiques plus préoccupés à piller les ressources du pays à jouir du pouvoir entre copains et à régler des comptes personnels.
Mesdames et Messieurs dans le même registre sécuritaire plus de 2300 écoles sont fermées à ce jour. Plus de 325.000 élèves ne partent plus à l’école et environ 10.000 enseignants se retrouvent en chômage technique tandis que 10 autres ont perdu hélas la vie. Ce sont là des chiffres fournis par le Ministre en charge de l’Education nationale. 
Cela montre qu’en moyenne chaque semaine 12 écoles se ferment et près de 1700 élèves se retrouvent dans la rue. C’est une situation dramatique. 
A l’analyse le Gouvernement n’a plus le contrôle de la situation. C’est pourquoi nous l’exhortons à faire appel à toutes les compétences nationales et aux amis sincères du Burkina Faso afin de combattre l’hydre terroriste. 
Le régime de Roch Marc Christian KABORE a failli. Le reconnaître ce n’est pas une honte. Au contraire ce serait le début d’une recherche de solutions véritables pour sauver ce pays que nous aimons tous.

Chers journalistes
L’Opposition politique vous a annoncé à travers un communiqué de presse qu’elle est en train d’élaborer un Accord politique dans le but de remporter les élections couplées de Novembre 2020. Toutes les chances sont du côté de l’Opposition. Roch KABORE sera éliminé dès le premier tour à cause de gestion calamiteuse. Le MPP a même intérêt à changer de candidat car Roch KABORE est disqualifié aux yeux des Burkinabè pour diriger encore ce pays. 
Les déclarations du Bureau politique national du MPP sont vaines et manquent de crédibilité. En effet le rapport de force est du côté de l’Opposition politique et la marche vers le changement est irréversible.  

Mesdames et Messieurs 
Hier lundi 10 février la Commission électorale nationale indépendante (CENI) a officiellement lancé à Dédougou la révision des listes électorales en vue des élections couplées du 22 novembre 2020.
L’Opposition politique se réjouit du lancement de l’opération. Elle demande à la CENI de tirer les leçons du passé pour un bon déroulement de l’enrôlement et une forte participation des citoyens. 
En outre l’Opposition invite l’ensemble des citoyens burkinabè qui ont 18 ans ou plus à s’inscrire sur le fichier électoral pour pouvoir voter le changement le 22 novembre prochain. 
L’enrôlement incluant les différents types d’élections à venir la CENI a demandé la prise d’un décret autorisant les jeunes âgés de 17 ans à s’enrôler pour pouvoir voter à partir des municipales de 2021. L’Opposition politique sera vigilante pour que cette initiative n’ouvre pas les p

All across China people are talking about Dr Li Wen Liang. He was the doctor who discovered the novel coronavirus and in the early morning of 7 Feb 2.58am he was promoted into glory and went home to be with our Father in heaven. 

Back in December last year he was arrested for being a whistle blower spreading rumors about a mysterious pneumonia like virus. 

This morning we found out he was infact a fellow brother in Christ. Our hearts are deeply moved by his sacrificial choice to spread awareness about the virus despite the risks he faced especially to his reputation and to his own health. 

He continued to care for patients up until he was infected himself. What a legacy to leave behind of what it means to be like Jesus to those hurting in a time of crisis. 
He chose to be an example of Immanuel God with us to the people of Wuhan. 

Can you imagine the joy he must have felt as he entered into eternity and heard the words Well done my good and faithful servant? 

So today please pray for his family especially his wife who is also infected and 8 months pregnant with their second child. May God heal them supernaturally n give them grace peace strength and comfort during this time.

Dr Li Wen Liang penned a deeply touching Chinese poem below of how he would miss his family his beloved Wuhan n quoted 2 Tim 4:7-8 I have fought the good fight I have finished the race I have kept the faith. Finally there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous Judge will give to me on that Day and not to me only but also to all who have loved His appearing.

The Hero Who Told The Truth

Here is a captivating heart-touching Chinese poem Ive tried to translate into English. It was written in memory of Mr Li Wenliang a Christian doctor and whistleblower who died from the coronavirus himself after being punished for issuing the first warning about the deadly coronavirus outbreak.

I dont want to be a hero.
I still have my parents
And my children
And my pregnant wife whos about to give birth
And many of my patients in the ward.
Though my integrity cannot be exchanged for the goodness of others
Despite my loss and confusion
I should proceed anyway.
Who let me choose this country and this family?
How many grievances do I have?
When this battle is over
I will look up to the sky
With tears like rain.

I dont want to be a hero.

And so many innocent people.
Though they are dying
They are always looking at me in their eyes
With their hope of life.

There is a light in the sky!
At the end of that light is the heaven that people often talk about.
But Id rather not go there.
Id rather go back to my hometown in Wuhan.
I have my new house there
For which I still have to pay off the loan every month.
How can I give up?
How can I give up?
For my parents without their son
How sad must it be?
For my sweetheart without her husband 
How can she face the vicissitudes in her future?

Shares of Gilead Sciences Inc. rallied in afternoon trading on Monday over investor excitement about a Coronavirus treatment candidate.

Gilead had said Jan. 31 that it is working with Chinese authorities to test its investigational antiviral remdesivir as a treatment for Coronavirus infections.

There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for the novel virus which was first identified in December in Wuhan China. Since then at least 361 people have died and 17205 have been sickened.

A paper published Jan. 31 in the New England Journal of Medicine outlined a positive response to Intravenous Remdesivir recorded in a patient undergoing treatment for pneumonia stemming from a Coronavirus infection. The 35-year-old man had recently returned to Snohomish County Washington from a trip to Wuhan. He was the first U.S. citizen to be diagnosed with the novel virus.

The newly introduced measures — which apply only in England — are among the first in Europe to allow the health authorities to keep individuals in quarantine if public health professionals believe they may be at risk of spreading the virus.

Four more people in Britain linked to a cluster of transmissions at a ski resort in France tested positive for the coronavirus bringing the total number of cases in the country to eight the health department announced Monday.

The coronavirus has sickened more than 40500 people mostly in China and at least 910 people have died since the virus first emerged in Wuhan a city of 11 million people in the central part of the country late last year. Since that time the virus has also spread to at least 24 countries triggering fears of a global pandemic.

The Department of Health and Social Care emphasized that the risk of contracting the coronavirus in Britain remained “moderate” even as the government empowered the health authorities to forcibly quarantine people. It also designated a hospital near Liverpool and a conference center northwest of London as isolation facilities for those placed under quarantine.

“I will do everything in my power to keep people in this country safe” Matt Hancock Britain’s health secretary said in a statement. “We are taking every possible step to control the outbreak of coronavirus.”

He added that it meant health care providers would be “supported with additional legal powers to keep people safe across the country” noting transmission of the coronavirus would “constitute a serious threat.”

The new measures were announced a day after a repatriation flight from Hubei Province — Wuhan is the largest city in the area — carrying about 200 citizens from Britain and elsewhere landed at an air force base in central England. British passengers were taken to the Kents Hill Park conference center about 50 miles northwest of London for 14 days of quarantine.

Twenty Germans who were on board the evacuation flight were brought to a Red Cross hospital in Berlin. Like 126 Germans who were picked up from Wuhan earlier this month those who arrived at the weekend agreed to a quarantine time of two weeks. There are 14 known cases of the virus across Germany.

By Monday morning eight people in England had tested positive for the coronavirus according to a statement from Professor Chris Whitty the Department of Health’s Chief Medical Officer for England doubling from a day earlier the known cases in the country.

“The new cases are all known contacts of a previously confirmed U.K. case and the virus was passed on in France” Professor Whitty said in a statement. “Experts at Public Health England continue to work hard tracing patient contacts from the U.K. cases. They successfully identified these individuals and ensured the appropriate support was provided.”

The new cases in Britain are linked to cases in France according to the French health authorities which all trace back to a group of British citizens staying in a chalet in the Alpine village of Les Contamines-Montjoie near Switzerland late last month.

A British man at the center of the transmissions is believed to have contracted the coronavirus while attending a conference in Singapore before flying  to Geneva on Jan. 24 and from there  the village where he shared lodgings with a group of fellow Britons.

The man then returned to Britain on Jan. 28 on an easyJet flight the budget airline confirmed in an emailed statement. He is among the eight people in Britain who have tested positive for the virus.

EasyJet said in an emailed statement that it had been notified by the public health authorities that a customer who had recently traveled on flight EZS8481 from Geneva to London Gatwick on Jan. 28 had since received a coronavirus diagnosis.

“Public Health England is contacting all passengers who were seated in the vicinity of the customer” the company said in a statement but noted that since the man had not been experiencing any symptoms the risk to others on board the flight was “very low.”

At least one of the people who tested positive for the virus was confirmed to be from Brighton a seaside town on England’s south coast and the BBC reported on Monday that the County Oak medical center there had to shut its doors after a member of staff tested positive for the virus.

A message on the center’s answering machine indicated it had been closed for an “urgent operational health and safety reason.”

A pub in nearby Hove The Grenadier said in a statement on its Facebook page that a person confirmed to have the virus had visited the establ

The challenges of the recent international and national events including the novel coronavirus and the east coast bushfires will undoubtedly have an impact on our State’s economy.

And despite our outstanding recent results in the tourism space the industry is taking a hit.

That’s why we’re taking immediate action to support WA’s tourism industry through our $12.85 million regional aviation and tourism package.

The new package will establish an $8 million regional airfare fund building on the State Government’s success in attracting more visitors through cheaper airfares to towns like Exmouth Monkey Mia and Broome.

Almost $5 million will be spent immediately to market and support initiatives that will drive more travellers to holiday in Western Australia and travel to the regions.

My Government will continue to do everything it can to support the Western Australian economy and create WA jobs.","426913580659855_3714290718588775","MarkMcGowanMP"

Potok claims he didn’t actually say he had coronavirus. He’s been charged with mischief and breach of recognizance.

Feb. 11 2020 7:03 AM ET

By Seeking Alpha:
Sprint is up more than 60% in premarket trading on reports that its long-awaited merger with T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) will finally be approved by U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero.

TMUS 9% premarket.

Fed Vice Chair Randal Quarles Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard are all set to comment at separate events later in the session.

This virus was specially engineered to take out colored people— Chinese Koreans Africans Indians — by the Nazi “Pure Blood” Eugenists —the same ones who are pushing the whole depopulation agenda.  It is especially aimed at Asian and African males and works by shutting down their cellular energy transfer system similar to shutting off the flow of electrical current in a machine. They just shut down all at once — death occurs in about sixty seconds. 

I guess we can be grateful that it is relatively quick and not painful but that is about all that can be said of it. 

It was again engineered by British M16 corporations using financing from Bill Gates among others.

Those with pure white Caucasian genes have little to worry about— unless the virus mutates into a form that can more efficiently access our lung tissue.   

Our friends and neighbors of color should be stocking up on coconut oil and essential oils and ultrasonic diffusers.  There are numerous essential oils that kill virus and bacteria of this kind including Oregano Oil and classic spice oils and mixtures of spice oils— clove cinnamon nutmeg allspice. 

Use the diffuser to distribute a fine mist of essential oil throughout the air and breathe it in so it kills any virus on surfaces and in the lungs and nasal passages. 

Mixing a few drops of essential oil with ten times the amount by volume with coconut oil as a carrier oil and swabbing it around the lips and nostrils and using it as a body oil on hands will also kill it. 

Large doses of Vitamin C — up to the point where stools are getting loose — will help finish the job inside the body. 

Limiting outside contact is of course advisable especially for colored people. 

Wearing masks won’t help with a virus and there is no sign of any accompanying bacterial infection— which is why the CDC and WHO are not promoting the use of masks.  

I hope that this unfolding nightmare is enough to wake people up to the EVIL in our midst and the extent that these madmen and madwomen will go to promote and realize their extremist ideas and prejudices.  

I hope it is not lost on colored people around the world that this has been created and unleashed by a tiny tiny fraction of the so-called “elites”— just a handful of unspeakable monsters — Nazi Eugenists who were allowed to live and perpetrate their poisonous beliefs in the wake of the Second World War. 

I hope that the Caucasian people of the world will use their relative immunity to serve and assist those of color and will close ranks only in their determination to eradicate once and for all time the “religion” of Babylon and the evil teachings of Nazism including prejudice against people of color and notions of “pure blood” and breeding and treating people as animals. 

The Romans realized too late that their tolerance of these venal “religious” practices and adoption of these elitist ideas was like a time bomb of self-destruction — a sort of booby-trap — left behind by the defeated Carthaginians. 

I pray that the governments of the West will wake up and realize that the Nazis have similarly aimed to snatch victory out of the jaws of defeat by inculcating their twisted ideas and venal “religion” into our schools and universities our governments and fraternal organizations and have spread them like the germs of a foul disease of the mind and heart to our military and scientific communities as well. 

These false beliefs and evil practices must be recognized for what they are and done away with once and for all time. 

All thinking men and women all feeling and sentient beings are called to stand firm against this and every other onslaught of EVIL.  

“Let not your hearts be troubled neither let them be afraid....” 

As this virus and the evil ideas that led to its creation are the handiwork of men we know also that we have the means to overcome this evil too.  What was created by men can be destroyed by men and this Our Father in Heaven will help us to do. 

As we turn from idolatry and fear and prejudice and self-interest and as we seek life and compassion with all our hearts and minds this contagion and all the other evil ideas and plots of the Evil Ones among us will be brought to nothing. 

They will disappear as if they never were and fade away into the Abyss. 

Re-focus your minds and hearts and think of the contagion in China in a different way— without fear and without horror.  

Imagine the Coronavirus and Nipah virus self-destructing mutating into harmless versions of themselves.  Tell the viruses to do this. Command them to do so. 

Imagine vast waves of healing and virus-specific bio-acoustic therapies being unleashed to cleanse China and everywhere else in the world preventing any Plague.

Concentrate on the evil men and women responsible for all this death and fear and on reflecting all the destruction back to them the guilty parties specifica

2 kali kena temperature screening. Hidung saya buat onar lah pula. Allergic rhinitis menyerang masa dalam pesawat. Aduh. Sangat tak selesa. Anti histamin dah pun saya ambil tapi itulah sementara tu merana lah sekejap.

Masih ada 2 jam sebelum kami ke Osaka. Sambil menunggu ni saya menonton rakaman Anugerah Juara Lagu 34. Cafe latte Starbucks kat sini sedap tak macam yang saya pernah minum sebelum ni. 

Tribute untuk Dato M. Nasir lah yang sebenarnya yang betul-betul memberi erti kata sebenar lagu-lagu Melayu. Dengan bersahaja Dato M. Nasir menyanyikan lagu Srikandi Cinta dan Suatu Masa tapi ia meresap ke dalam setiap lubuk perasaan saya. 

Dia mengingatkan saya betapa indahnya setiap nota dan bait lirik lagu yang dicipta dan digubahnya. Dia wajar sangat diangkat sebagai seniman. Saya membesar dibayangi lagu-lagu ciptaannya dan semuanya membawa saya kembali ke zaman di mana teknologi bukan seperti sekarang dan untuk mendengar lagu-lagu hanya melalui radio dan kaset. 

Saya masih ingat bagaimana gigihnya saya merakam lagu dalam radio untuk dikomplikasikan dalam kaset untuk dipasang dalam kereta Abah. Yang paling saya geram bila penyampai radio menyelit di saat lagu tengah dimainkan. Rosak lah rakaman yang saya cuba buat ketika tu. 

Saya sudah pun 42 tahun. Dato M. Nasir masih tetap sama rupanya tak dimakan usia kan. Padahal dia dah 62 tahun. Pada saya dia tetap nampak seperti mana saya melihatnya sejak saya berumur belasan tahun.

In addition to the illness death and fear that the coronavirus has effectuated the global economy has suffered a major $160 billion blow. In China Apple McDonald’s Starbucks and dozens of other chains have closed their stores. Entire cities have been shut down and most of the “Made in China” industry has been frozen.

Humanity has yet to digest the magnitude of disruption that China the country with the world’s largest population can inflict. China has become a cold mega-factory operating to serve its own money and power interests on the backs of an impoverished sweated labor workforce. It has developed into a powerful and assertive country with its tentacles spread throughout the world. 

The vast amount of harm that the coronavirus has triggered makes a clear point: Nature disagrees with such a quickly expansive self-benefit-focused approach. The integral and altruistic quality of nature requires each of its parts to complement one another thereby harmonizing themselves with the whole. For this reason it is imperative that we stop for a moment and critique the situation that the crisis in China presents since humanity is not above nature’s laws. 

History is replete with examples of the rise and fall of powerful empires that sought to aggrandize themselves at the expense of others: Ancient Egypt the Babylonian Roman and Mongolian Empires colonial Britain and France the Nazi regime the Soviet Union and the list goes on. The reason behind every collapse is that ultimately nature forbids overblown egoism to trample the world unabated with one country or empire having pirate access to much of the world’s resources.

More blows such as the coronavirus can be expected if China continues to fiercely expand its power around the world at the expense of other countries and populations. These crises could take many grave forms—lethal diseases financial ruin wars and more. The press of human development has brought us to an era characterized by inescapable global interdependence. There are no more empty spaces and we have nowhere to hide. The crises will only intensify. 

The magnifying glass is now over China to undergo this attitude shift: to become positively connected with and concerned about humanity’s growth and success. We are all in the same boat. Therefore if someone adds too much weight on their side we will all topple over. China’s current egoistic expansion is doing just that. It is a recipe for disaster. China thus needs to shift its robust influence in the direction of benefiting the whole world instead of benefiting only itself. 

Therefore I hope that China and the world will rush to treat the underlying disease of the egoistic nature residing within us and not settle for merely calming the coronavirus crisis. When we learn to think globally instead of nationally the world finally will experience peace stability and harmony.

MarketWatch.com – Top Stories

Micron Technology Inc. shares rallied to lead gains among chip maker stocks Wednesday after another analyst declared the memory-chip glut of 2019 over and boosted his rating on the stock.

Micron              MU 3.90%            shares rallied 3.9% to $59.50 after touching an intraday high of $61.19 and were on track for their highest close since June 13 2018 when they finished at $60.05 and the memory-chip market was in the middle of its most recent boom. Micron led gainers on the PHLX Semiconductor Index              SOX 1.32%           which rose 1.3% Wednesday.

On Wednesday UBS analyst Timothy Acuri raised his rating on Micron to a buy from neutral and hiked his price target to $75 from $47 on the basis that the memory market is setting Micron up to be able to “materially outperform over a sustained period of time.”

“We consider both the cyclical and structural aspects to both MU and the memory industry as a whole and conclude that MU is in a much stronger position in a structurally better industry on the cusp of a cyclical upswing that for DRAM should last deep into C2021” Acuri said.

Micron specializes in DRAM and NAND memory chips. DRAM or dynamic random access memory is the type of memory commonly used in PCs and servers while NAND chips are the flash memory chips used in USB drives and smaller devices such as digital cameras.

Acuri said he sees “clear signs that the industry is moving toward a somewhat undersupplied environment” in DRAM and expects a “full” seven quarters of undersupply that will extend into 2021. For NAND Acuri expects the market to be “somewhat” undersupplied in the first half of 2020 with “the industry tipping back into moderate levels of oversupply” in 2021.

Additionally with data centers resuming purchases after last year’s lull as evidenced in recent results from Intel Corp.             INTC 0.14%            and buzz leading up to Nvidia Corp.             NVDA 1.19%            earnings on Thursday DRAM sales stand to see a big boost.

“After a pause in H2:20182019 we are seeing indications that hyperscalers are resuming purchases of server DRAM as inventories have normalized” Acuri said. “Our field work indicates that hyperscaler procurement accelerated in December 2019 with robust forecasts for 1H:20.”

Optimism in the memory chip market has been growing steadily getting a boost from CES in January. Back in December Micron called a bottom in its financial performance as more analysts expressed optimism about the memory chip market that suffered oversupply problems for more than a year.

Read: For chip companies stocks soared as sales slumped in 2019 — what does that mean for 2020?

Over the past 12 months Micron shares are up 47% with the bulk of that growth coming in the past three months. That compares with a 46% rise in the SOX index a 23% rise in the S&P 500 index              SPX 0.55%           and a 31% gain in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index              COMP 0.76%.

Of the 34 analysts who cover Micron 26 have overweight ratings five have hold ratings and three have underweight or sell ratings along with an average target price of $66.46 according to FactSet data. In late December 35 analysts covered the stock with 18 buy ratings nine hold ratings and three sell ratings along with an average target price of $57.77.

Miércoles 12 de Febrero de 2020 

Una farmacéutica china dijo que ha comenzado a producir en masa un fármaco experimental de Gilead Sciences Inc. el cual podría combatir el nuevo coronavirus a medida que China acelera las medidas para encontrar un tratamiento al brote cada vez extendido.

BrightGene Bio-Medical Technology Co. con sede en Suzhou dijo que ha desarrollado la tecnología necesaria para sintetizar los ingredientes farmacéuticos activos de remdesivir el fármaco de Gilead que es el principal candidato para tratar el virus altamente infeccioso y el cual ha provocado la muerte de más de 1.000 personas. El medicamento aún no tiene licencia o aprobación en ningún lugar del mundo. La compañía subió un 20% en bolsa el miércoles.

BrightGene dijo que tiene la intención de obtener la licencia para el medicamento de Gilead pero su decisión de comenzar a fabricar en esta etapa temprana es muy inusual y podría suponer una posible infracción de la propiedad intelectual de la compañía estadounidense. Se produce una semana después de que los investigadores chinos presentaran una solicitud para patentar el medicamento con el objetivo de tratar el nuevo coronavirus lo que daría a China influencia sobre el uso global de la terapia para combatir el brote.

“En general la producción constituye una infracción de patente pero hay una excepción si la producción está destinada únicamente a la aprobación regulatoria y no a la venta en el mercado” dijo Wang Yanyu socia especializada en propiedad intelectual del bufete AllBright Law Offices en Pekín.

Grandes áreas de China están paralizadas por la epidemia de coronavirus y el medicamento de Gilead se considera un posible avance después de que mostrase señales de eficacia en pacientes infectados en Estados Unidos. Los investigadores chinos ahora están probando el medicamento en 761 pacientes en ensayos clínicos en Wuhan.

BrightGene dijo que tendrá que licenciar la patente de Gilead realizar ensayos clínicos y obtener aprobaciones regulatorias antes de poder vender el medicamento en el mercado. La tecnología que ha desarrollado para producir remdesivir podría no ser de mucho valor si el medicamento no produce resultados ideales en los ensayos clínicos en curso o si la epidemia se controla pronto dijo.

Gilead no respondió de inmediato a una solicitud de comentarios. La semana pasada la compañía dijo que inventó remdesivir y que la había patentado en China incluida la presentación de solicitudes de patentes para su uso en coronavirus. La compañía también dijo que está trabajando con cargos chinos estadounidenses y de la Organización Mundial de la Salud para determinar con rapidez si el medicamento es eficaz para tratar el virus. BrightGene no respondió de inmediato a las consultas de Bloomberg sobre la producción remdesivir.","106691144131771_149610636506488","FM.Limite.92.7"

Coronavirus: Five Britons in French ski chalet catch virus

>Five Britons have tested positive for coronavirus in eastern France the French health minister has confirmed.
>Four adults and a child were diagnosed with the virus after coming into contact with a British national who recently returned from Singapore
The Brighton man told UK authorities that he had visited a chalet in Contamines-Montjoie prompting French officials to take the 11 Britons staying there to hospitals in Lyon Saint-Etienne and Grenoble on Friday night.
>The chalet has two apartments where two families were staying. A British couple and their three children who are now resident in France lived in one. The mother is in the UK at the moment and has been contacted.
>Seven of their friends were staying in the other apartment.
>Those with the virus are the father of the family resident in France and his nine-year-old son as well as three members of the visiting family. 
>The nine-year-old boy attends the local school and has French classes at another school in St-Gervais. Both schools will be shut next week and parents are being asked to keep their children under observation.
>A crisis unit has been set up as a result of the new cases.
>It comes as four members of the same British family were admitted to hospital in Majorca after contact with a coronavirus carrier.
>They are being tested at the University Hospital of Son Espases in Palma.
>The British family said they had been in contact with a person who recently tested positive for the virus in France the government in Spains Balearic Islands said.","100000853616520_2844633795575046","szilard.locsei"

By Michael Le Page

People in London are concerned the coronavirus will reach the city

THE new coronavirus is now spreading in several countries. As New Scientist went to press eight cases of infection had been confirmed in the UK including a man who went home to Brighton from a conference in Singapore via a ski resort in France.

Four other people on the ski trip were diagnosed as infected after returning to the UK including a doctor. The medical centre where the doctor works has now been shut. A further five people at the ski resort were diagnosed while still in France and one other case was confirmed on return to Spain.

So is the rest of the world ready for the coronavirus? The short answer is no. “I am utterly convinced that no country is fully prepared” says Jennifer Nuzzo at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Maryland.

Serious disease outbreaks pose three threats. There is the direct impact in terms of illness and deaths. Then there are people with other illnesses who are disadvantaged because health services are overwhelmed. For instance regular vaccinations ceased during recent Ebola outbreaks in West Africa leading to children dying of other diseases. Finally there is the economic impact of travel bans and people not working.

Nuzzo is one of the authors of the Global Health Security Index which scores countries out of 100 based on their ability to cope with these threats.

The average score in 2019 was just 40. China scored 48. The US UK the Netherlands Australia and Canada top the ranking with scores ranging from 84 to 75 but they too will struggle if the coronavirus becomes a pandemic and spreads globally even if it isn’t especially deadly says Nuzzo.

For now the aim is to stop the coronavirus from spreading. The strategy is to identify people who are infected quarantine them and trace their contacts in case any are infected too.

Imminent threat

As long as the number of cases spreading beyond China remains a trickle rich countries are well placed to do this. But many poorer countries don’t yet have the capacity to test for the virus.

Hospitals in the US and the UK are preparing isolation facilities and on Monday the UK declared the virus an imminent threat allowing the country to forcibly quarantine people.

There are concerns that some countries aren’t providing sufficient funding and training. “Bottom line: they aren’t taking this seriously enough” US senator Chris Murphy tweeted last week after attending a briefing on the US government’s preparations.

Isolating all infected people in hospitals and tracing their contacts also works only if case numbers remain low. If case numbers rise it doesn’t make sense to fill hospitals with people with mild infections who don’t need treatment.

At this point the strategy would have to switch to asking people with mild cases to isolate themselves at home and treating people who are seriously ill in communal wards.

“If coronavirus is worse than swine flu it will be horrendously difficult to handle”

“In that case we are in an epidemic situation” says Mark Woolhouse at the University of Edinburgh UK. “We won’t be able to control it and it will have to run its course.”

Paul Hunter at the University of East Anglia UK thinks a coronavirus pandemic would be no worse than the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. Efforts to contain this outbreak after it began in Mexico failed and it spread globally infecting up to a quarter of the population and killing up to 500000 – a death rate of approximately 0.02 per cent.

Nuzzo agrees it is plausible a coronavirus pandemic could be similar to swine flu but says the US would be hard-pressed to manage even in this scenario.

However there are reasons to think a coronavirus pandemic could be worse than the 2009 pandemic was. Infected people seem to pass the virus on to between two and four others on average compared with about 1.5 for flu says Woolhouse. There is also no pre-existing immunity against coronavirus whereas older people had some against H1N1.

Woolhouse stresses that he isn’t predicting that a coronavirus pandemic will be worse than H1N1 was. “But we should at least think about what we would do in those circumstances” he says.

The UK authorities have planned only for a pandemic similar to 2009. They are currently discussing whether a more severe outbreak is a reasonable concern says Woolhouse.

“If it is worse than H1N1 then it would be horrendously difficult to handle” says Hunter.

No one can say for sure what will happen. But Nuzzo thinks it is already too late to stop the virus going pandemic and that China’s drastic measures to contain it will cause a lot of harm. “I’m really worried about the potential disruption that their measures will cause” s

Our city is having a real shock. A global crisis has made its way into our local community and it’s making us all really anxious.

Since the last update I have had daily sometimes hourly contact with the health authorities and government ministers. I’m in direct contact with Department of Health ministers the Cheif Medical Officer’s office Brighton and Hove Council and the commissioning body for health across our city. I can’t instruct any of our public services but what I can do is make sure the voice of our community is heard loud and clear as decisions are being taken I can test decisions with the people who make them and I can ensure that all of the different agencies are working together. 

I have also tried my absolute best to communicate as much as I can and share as much information as I can so as well as social media I’ve been on TV and the radio a lot and briefing journalists not only in our city and country but from around the world - there is a lot of interest in what is happening here and how we are responding to the challenge. 

Partly the reason why I’ve had to do so much communicating is because others haven’t been doing enough of it. I wish public health officials were more communicative. 

I know there is a huge amount of anxiety and many of you want access to more information about the people who have contracted Coronavirus and their movements. This has posed a real challenge. Let me explain why.

Something I’ve noticed is that public health officials are extremely reluctant to release information unless it is categorically grounded in scientific evidence. They fear releasing information that either dates quickly or is contradicted by events in the days after. Coronavirus is new it’s only been in this form for a matter of weeks and whereas there are very clear indications about how it is passed on there is a reticence to announce it as fact. That means that by the time statements are announced it often uses a convoluted language that causes frustration among people. 

Secondly and most difficult has been the decision not to release information about the movements of people who have been found to have Coronavirus. I know this has upset some people because many have contacted me to express anger. When I have challenged health officials about it the answer has been to explain the strategy of how the situation is being managed. In China because the virus has already spread so far they are being reactive by shutting down transport systems schools and workplaces. In Britain because the numbers are relatively low we have the resources to identify every person they have had contact with trace them and ask them to do the neighbourly thing of staying home away from people until tests are returned or symptoms emerge - this has been given the scientific name of ‘self isolation’ but in reality it’s what we all do if we have a heavy cold flu or kids might have nits - we’re cautious and do our bit to stop friends and neighbours catching it.

But we know that some school students pub staff and community centre managers have been asked to stay home and it’s caused real anxiety for people who wonder if they too have been in places where exposure to the virus could have happened. But here’s the key thing: it’s people not places that are at the heart of how Coronavirus spreads and it’s not just being in the same general space as someone with the virus that poses a danger because it has to be a very specific kind of contact. We know with a high degree of certainty that you need to be in very close proximity of someone with the virus for about 15 minutes or when they sneeze. To be specific droplets of saliva containing the virus need to pass directly from one mouth to another. 

Some people have contacted me asking for very specific information of where people with the virus have travelled. I don’t have that information to release but when I tell the authorities that people are asking for it I am told that all of the people at risk have been traced or are being traced and told directly. If you’ve not been contacted you don’t need to worry. They are also prioritising those people that scientific and medical evidence suggests are most at risk. That’s why some people in a pub were asked to stay home but others weren’t and some students were asked to stay home but others weren’t. I really do understand why this approach causes alarm because we must put a huge amount of trust in the people making these decisions but as of today these are the facts as I have been able to ascertain them:

- Of the 5 cases of Coronavirus in Brighton and Hove *all of them* caught it in another country. 

- The first person known to have contracted Coronavirus from Brighton and Hove has fully recovered has no traces of the virus left and has been released from medical isolation and is back with his family.

- The remaining people we know

Current Situation (Feb. 7 2020): The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the Military Health System and the U.S. Army Public Health Center are closely monitoring an outbreak of a respiratory illness caused by the Wuhan City Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). There are no cases involving DoD beneficiaries and only 12 confirmed cases are under isolation within the U.S.  Additionally these 12 cases have either a travel history to China andor direct contact with an infected individual. This virus is not currently spreading within the U.S. community. The immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV to the general American public is low.

Symptoms: People infected with 2019-nCoV may experience mild to severe lower respiratory symptoms (pneumonia) such as fever cough and difficulty taking a deep breath.    

What to do if you think you’re at risk for this illness: During the last 14 days if you have returned from China or have had close contact with a patient diagnosed with 2019-nCoV AND are experiencing symptoms of fever cough and difficulty breathing please call the GLWACH Emergency Department at 573-596-0456 for guidance. Calling first will minimize potential spread of the virus and ensure GLWACH staff can best prepare and care for you.

Transmission: The 2019-nCoV is spread through respiratory droplets like other cold and flu viruses.  It is most commonly spread from an infected person to others through:
• coughing and sneezing
• close contact with an infected person  
• touching an object or surface with the virus on it then touching your mouth nose or eyes before washing your hands

How to protect yourself and others:  As with any respiratory viral illness the CDC recommends implementing the following practices to lower your risk of becoming ill and spreading sickness to others especially during cold and flu season:
• wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
• avoid touching your eyes nose or mouth with unwashed hands
• avoid close contact with people who are sick and stay home while you’re sick
• clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces
• ensure you cover your cough or sneeze when experiencing these symptoms. If you are experiencing these symptoms please wear a mask if you visit GLWACH. Masks are available at hygiene stations located outside clinics and near the elevators.

Stay safe and stay well

All Chinese wish for friends to be safe and sound any such information makes the heart miserable which is not in the hands of humans such destruction is more deadly for innocent humans and beings.

The Wuhan Corona Virus Outbreak (2019–20) began in mid-December of 2019 in Wuhan city of central China as a new type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. Many people started getting pneumonia without any reason and it was seen that most of the people who are suffering from huan seafood market sell fish and also trade live animals. 2019-nCoV was given the initial designation by Chinese scientists who later identified a new breed of coronavirus. This new virus found at least 70 percent of the same genome sequences found in SARS-Coronavirus. With the development of a specific diagnostic PCR test to detect the infection many cases were confirmed in those who were directly connected to the market and those who were not directly connected to the market. It is not yet clear whether this virus is of the same severity or malignancy as SARS.
On 20 January 2020 Chinese Premier Li Keqiang urged a decisive and effective effort to prevent and control the pneumonia epidemic caused by Navel Coronavirus.  By 10 February 2020 there have been 910 deaths in China.  There is evidence of this virus across China and human-to-human transmission.  Extensive testing has revealed more than 40554 confirmed cases  some of which include health workers. Are  There have also been confirmed cases in Thailand South Korea Japan Taiwan Macau Hong Kong United States Singapore and Vietnam.

On 23 January 2020 the World Health Organization decided against declaring the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern.

Please dont believe everyhing that you see on Social Media and all the other channels. We all are taking precautions advised by the government. 
About prevention: 
? The most common way of getting infected is by touching things in public so you must wash your hands frequently. The virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 mins but a lot can happen in those 5-10 mins (you can rub your eyes or touch your face unintentionally). 

? Aside from washing your hands frequently you can gargle with Betadine Sore Throat Gargle to eliminate or minimize the germs while they are still in your throat (before dripping down to your lungs). 

? Stay Hydrated

? Do not speculate and spread false news or rumours to create more confusion. The whole country is anyway in a panic mode and the Government is doing its best to tackle the situation. 

? Lets not stock up on groceries toilet rolls diapers baby food formula and empty the super markets. Please think about those who might be in need! 

? Keep your little ones at home and avoid any exposure to large number of people or gatherings.

------------------------------------

SHANGHAI -- Nearly 100 Chinese businesses have been certified to invoke force majeure exemptions from contractual duties by a government trade council that deems the coronavirus outbreak as a qualifying disaster.

Under Chinese law force majeure -- or act of God -- provisions are usually declared in the event of war natural disaster or intervention by state authorities. Commercial contracts generally contain such clauses and if those conditions are met a company is exempt from delivering goods or paying invoices among other previously agreed-upon obligations.

When the coronavirus epidemic went into high gear at the end of last month the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade started to issue force majeure certificates recognizing the outbreak as a triggering event.

The certificates themselves are not free passes but they can be used during negotiation between relevant parties said Masanori Kawai an attorney for the Tokyo-based law firm Nagashima Ohno & Tsunematsu.

When an enterprise declares it cannot fulfill contractual obligations under force majeure provisions the parties involved will first attempt to negotiate a settlement. Failing that the dispute moves to legal proceedings such as a court or an arbitration panel.

In the wake of the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 Chinese courts lowered breach-of-contract fees by more than two-thirds. This time around it is widely believed that the courts will generally side with domestic companies hit by the coronavirus.

Auto parts maker Huzhou Huida Machinery Manufacturing faces delays on deliveries to clients in Africa because local governments back home extended the official Lunar New Year holiday to at least Feb. 9 from the originally planned end date of Jan. 30.

With the lack of deliveries handicapping operations at client facilities Huida could be asked to pay about 30 million yuan ($4.3 million) in damages. The company successfully applied for a force majeure certificate from the trade council and the parts maker will negotiate smaller remuneration with client companies.

By issuing the certificates the trade council will try our best to protect such enterprises by reducing their economic losses to the minimum said Ding Guming director of legal affairs with the Huzhou branch.

Some Japanese corporations appear to have encountered force majeure actions by their Chinese business partners. Liuzhou Glory Zinc Minmetchem received a certificate as it encounters delays in delivering goods to a Japanese chemical trader.

Production lines are not operational as of Monday said a Glory Zinc representative. Deliveries are likely to be made in March.

At least 97 Chinese enterprises had received force majeure certificates from the council as of Monday. The industries cut across a wide spectrum including steel apparel paper products and construction materials.

The list apparently includes the Chinese arms of foreign multinationals as well. With the list expected to grow much longer the force majeure proceedings will spread to more Japanese companies.

Major Chinese groups are also invoking force majeure protections. CNOOC has cited the coronavirus as the reason to put off contractually obligated purchases of liquefied natural gas according to state media reports.

A state-owned shipbuilder has apparently declared force majeure as well to renegotiate delivery times for vessels with the move due in part to difficulty securing manpower.

Chinese authorities are scrambling to put together a package that will ease the impact of the coronavirus on the business sector and economy at large. The Peoples Bank of China the nations central bank hinted at a rate cut this month and is instructing banks against cutting back or recalling loans. Regional governments are likely to step up infrastructure investments.

Considering the force majeure certificates are part of the overall initiative to alleviate the outbreaks repercussions state actions and court judgments may tend to favor Chinese enterprises. International companies doing business in China could be pressed to make concessions on delivery dates and breach-of-contract penalties.

(I dont feel that I am an ordinary courier. I now shoulder more responsibility than before.)

Editors note: The novel coronavirus outbreak is weighing heavily on peoples lives and minds. But many are working hard to keep cities running and trying to spread a little happiness. Here we take a look at their stories.

For days the streets of Wuhan capital of Hubei province and epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak have been deserted.

Buses and the subway have stopped running. With the exception of a few taxis and private hire vehicles the roads are otherwise eerily empty.

While the majority of residents have opted to remain at home people such as Yuan Shuang are doing their bit to ensure that the city of 11 million people does not come to a complete halt.

Yuan a courier with Danniao Logistics has documented his daily activities since the outbreak through his video blog updating viewers about the situation.

He arrives at his warehouse at 6:50 am every day. The first thing he and his colleagues do is check their temperatures to ensure they are not running a fever.

At 8:30 am Yuan starts to load goods into a minivan before transporting them to destinations across the city. The packages bearing yellow labels are essential supplies that need to be delivered first. Some 80 percent of Yuans parcels contain face masks and disinfectants while the remainder have food and beverages.

At 12:45 pm Yuan drives back to the warehouse to have lunch a simple meal comprising a bowl of rice pork and green peppers. Once he finishes eating he immediately returns to work.

I dont feel that I am an ordinary courier. I now shoulder more responsibility than before he said.

FURTHER EXTRACTS

As of this morning China has reported that the Wuhan coronavirus has infected more than 4500 people and killed more than 100. But the real number is likely far higher—perhaps in the hundreds of thousands—given the Chinese Communist Party’s long history of covering up and minimizing these crises.

China’s own actions demonstrate the severity of the threat. Beijing has quarantined more than 50 million people—the combined population of our entire West Coast—and cancelled school indefinitely. Just this morning Hong Kong has slashed travel from mainland China. These are not the actions of a government in control of the outbreak.

It may be too late for China to contain the virus inside its borders. The mayor of Wuhan for instance acknowledged that more than five million people had already left the city despite the quarantine. Further Chinese researchers have provided strong evidence in The Lancet that this coronavirus did not originate in the Wuhan seafood market contrary to the official Chinese line. This evidence doesn’t just cast doubt on Chinese reporting but also suggests the risk of infectious pathways outside the seafood market.....

...it appears that this coronavirus has a long incubation period and asymptomatic persons may be able to transmit the virus. If so then the administration’s laudable efforts to screen persons traveling from China could be for naught: no amount of screening will identify a contagious but asymptomatic person afflicted with the coronavirus.

Given these dangerous circumstances a targeted travel ban is warranted to protect Americans until we know more about the virus and the outbreak is under control. I propose steps along the following lines:

First commercial flights from China to the U.S. should be halted immediately. There’s no need for recreational student or educational or non-critical business travel under the circumstances until this crisis is under control.

Second American citizens in China and their immediate family members should have the option to evacuate and return to U.S. territory under appropriate elevated monitoring.

Third the administration should develop strict criteria for allowing critical trade to continue such as cargo flights and seaborne shipping to minimize the impact to the U.S. economy. The administration should ensure that individuals who do arrive in the U.S. under these criteria can be adequately screened and quarantined as needed.

Fourth the administration should allow medical personnel and scientists to travel to and from China to address this crisis.

------------
I can scarcely complain about the above recommendations given that I have called for a similar ban to be placed on the same category of flights from China and in the very near future Hong Kong Singapore and other nations in SE Asia with high infection zones.

The inadequacy of airport screening methods particularly when thousands of travellers including many asymptomaatic carriersare arriving daily from high infection zones means that the coronavirus has now become a clear and present danger to the health of EU citizens and economic social stability within Europe and beyond.This inadequacy together with the recorded swift transmission rate of the virus in Wuhan means IMHO that senator Cotton is right to call it out and call for changes.

Senator Cotton along with others have been warning that the global community faces a possibly calamitous pandemic for weeks and he was not IMHObeing alarmist in the conference speech he made around the start of February to members of the Senate Armed Services Committeeto have declared that the corona outbreak is the biggest and most important story in the world and worse than Chernobyl.

Conclusion of My Research Into The Year of Entrepreneurial Criminal Activity That Led to The Coronovirus Epidemic

No Government Deliberately Released The Virus

There is less to fear from the coronavirus if you are outside Central China than you might think from reading and watching the media whether it is the mass media regurgitate official statements blaming bats or the hysterical media like Alex Jones bellowing the word “bioweapon” to sell his silver throat gargle he all but says will shield you from viral attack.

Both types of media have the origin and trajectory wrong leaving an understandably skeptical four billion Internet users to speculate with the most scary projections or emotion inducing images getting the most attention.

To claim state actors deliberately released a bioweapon IF there is a more plausible explanation (why now just as the USChina trade treaty was about to end the long running dispute?) is the height of irresponsibility as a belief in a bio attack would be an act of war that could be a lie that caused millions of deaths... more than the coronavirus.

So let’s look at the most plausible explanation.

In the interests of preventing deaths based on calls for revenge I post the following which should be the working hypothesis unless and until evidence falsifying it is found and so far as of February 11 2020 there is no such evidence.

We also have the evidence of much slower growth internationally of the deaths attributed to coronovirus which is explained by my hypothesis and not by the mass media story.

The coronavirus is here because four lab assistants at Wuhan Virology Institute started selling experimental research animals to the Wuhan wet market (where at least one of them if not all four used to work) starting a year ago for food consumption instead of disposing of them as these workers were supposed to according to the medical protocols they all knew and all ignored for profit.

They made the equivalent of tens of thousand of dollars from these animal sales but at the cost of what will end up being tens of thousand of lives and tens of billions of dollars in economic losses.

I’m not saying what I think these numbers of lives lost and economic loss will end up being because these estimates are too large to have a rational discussion around... yet.

It’s that proximity of cutting edge bioweapons research vaccine testing profit motive inconsistent legal enforcement lack of execution and deterrence and willingness to eat animals that coincidentally are also animals used in research that led to this tragedy.

There is a really good reason people buy food from trusted brands: you can hold them accountable for their food sourcing as officials can see the entire documented process of the food supply chain.

But a guy who walks up with a dog he wants to sell you as meat? You have no idea where that dog has been or what is inside that dog.

If someone in Wuhan buys a dog cat rat or monkey at a wet market to eat how do they know that this animal didn’t spend the last year in a cage at Wuhan Virology Institute getting the latest experimental vaccinations and then get injected or exposed to coronavirus Ebola etc.?

They don’t. They incorrectly associate “living” with “very fresh” and “fresh” with “safe and healthy to eat”.

But this is a logical fallacy of the deadliest variety.

There is good news and bad news.

The good news is that sometimes the vaccines worked and the animals survived something that would kill you.

The bad news is that just because an animal survived does not mean all the viruses or bacteria ? died inside the animal.

We humans are host to an average of 23 trillion living things almost as many as our average 27 trillion cells.

If you think it’s impossible that people would buy living dogs cats rats and monkeys to eat in China Google it and you’ll find videos.

I have seen it and can even imitate the over the top sales pitches I have received to try to get me to eat for example “big yella dog” by someone who followed me for blocks incredulous I didn’t want to buy a Golden Retriever to slaughter and eat.

If you think it’s impossible that lab assistants could sneak animals out of a category 4 virus research lab google the reports of multiple breaches.

If you think it’s impossible that anyone could be so unethical to sell tainted food google and read up on the many scandals around fake food that have also killed thousands (cumulatively hundreds of thousands) of Chinese.

Here are a few search strings to get your google research started

Fake milk kills infants in China
Fake rice in China
Fake eggs in China
25 year old meat sold in China
Pigs dead from flu sold in China

Let’s talk about that last one.

Over 250 million pigs have been killed China by responsible Chinese farmers trying to be good citizens in cooperation

He was the doctor who discovered the novel coronavirus and in the early morning of 7 Feb 2.58am he was promoted into glory and went home to be with our Father in heaven. 

Back in December last year he was arrested for being a whistle blower spreading rumors about a mysterious pneumonia like virus. This morning we found out he was infact a fellow brother in Christ. Our hearts are deeply moved by his sacrificial choice to spread awareness about the virus despite the risks he faced especially to his reputation and to his own health. 

He continued to care for patients up until he was infected himself. What a legacy to leave behind of what it means to be like Jesus to those hurting in a time of crisis. 
He chose to be an example of Immanuel God with us to the people of Wuhan. 
Can you imagine the joy he must have felt as he entered into eternity and heard the words Well done my good and faithful servant? 

So today please pray for his family especially his wife who is also infected and 8 months pregnant with their second child. May God heal them supernaturally n give them grace peace strength and comfort during this time.

Dr Li Wen Liang penned a deeply touching Chinese poem below of how he would miss his family his beloved Wuhan n quoted 2 Tim 4:7-8 I have fought the good fight I have finished the race I have kept the faith. Finally there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous Judge will give to me on that Day and not to me only but also to all who have loved His appearing.

The Hero Who Told The Truth

Here is a captivating heart-touching Chinese poem Ive tried to translate into English. It was written in memory of Mr Li Wenliang a Christian doctor and whistleblower who died from the coronavirus himself after being punished for issuing the first warning about the deadly coronavirus outbreak.

I dont want to be a hero.
I still have my parents
And my children
And my pregnant wife whos about to give birth
And many of my patients in the ward.
Though my integrity cannot be exchanged for the goodness of others
Despite my loss and confusion
I should proceed anyway.
Who let me choose this country and this family?
How many grievances do I have?
When this battle is over
I will look up to the sky
With tears like rain.

I dont want to be a hero.
But as a doctor
I cannot just see this unknown virus
Hurting my peers
And so many innocent people.
Though they are dying
They are always looking at me in their eyes
With their hope of life.

“Who would have ever realised that I was going to die?
My soul is in heaven
Looking at the white bed
On which lies my own body
With the same familiar face.
Where are my parents?
And my dear wife
The lady I once had a hard time chasing?

At the end of that light is the heaven that people often talk about.
But Id rather not go there.
Id rather go back to my hometown in Wuhan.
I have my new house there
For which I still have to pay off the loan every month.
How can I give up?
How can I give up?
For my parents without their son
How sad must it be?
For my sweetheart without her husband 
How can she face the vicissitudes in her future?

Putting it into a bag

Gone like me

It has applied for a patent for the use of the drug know as remdesivir to treat the novel coronavirus. The move is a sign that China views Gilead’s therapy as one of the most promising candidates to fight the outbreak that has now claimed almost 500 lives. A patent battle may affect Gilead’s control over the drug in China.

While Gilead’s experimental drug isn’t licensed or approved anywhere in the world it is being rushed into human trials in China on coronavirus patients after showing early signs of being highly effective.

The patent application was made on Jan. 21 according to a statement posted on the website of the virology institute in Wuhan the central Chinese city at the epicenter of the epidemic. Scientists there have found Gilead’s remdesivir and chloroquine an 80-year-old malaria drug “highly effective” in laboratory studies at thwarting the novel coronavirus they said Tuesday in a paper in the journal Cell Research. The two drugs’ efficacies on humans required further clinical tests the institute said in the statement.

China is capable of manufacturing chloroquine and now wants access to remdesivir. It is not clear if or when China’s intellectual property authorities will approve the institute’s application.

Gilead’s experimental drug is at present entering clinical trials in China on patients with the novel coronavirus. The company is shipping enough doses to treat 500 patients and is ramping up supply in case the clinical trials work.

Remdesivir is being tested in two trials in China in patients with moderate and severe symptoms of the novel pathogen said Merdad Parsey Gilead’s chief medical officer.

The Wuhan institute said in its statement that it made the patent application out of national interest and won’t exercise its patent rights if foreign pharmaceutical firms work together with China to curb the contagion.

Yawen Chen Elaine Lies

6 MIN READ

BEIJINGTOKYO (Reuters) - The Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak reported a record rise in deaths and thousands more infections using a broader definition on Thursday while Japan became the third place outside mainland China to suffer a fatality.

The epidemic has given China’s ruling Communist Party one of its sternest challenges in years constrained the world’s second largest economy and triggered a purge of provincial bureaucrats.

Japan confirmed its first coronavirus death - a woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa prefecture near Tokyo - adding to two previous fatalities in Hong Kong and the Philippines.

Japan is one of the worst affected of more than two dozen other countries and territories that have seen hundreds of infections from the flu-like virus.

The Japanese woman fell ill in January but only later showed symptoms of pneumonia and was hospitalised with coronavirus confirmed after her death and the contagion route under investigation the health minister said.

The biggest cluster of infections outside China is on a cruise liner now quarantined off a Japanese port and a further 44 cases were reported on board on Thursday raising the total to 219. But authorities said some elderly people would finally to be allowed to disembark on Friday.

“Outside the cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship we are not seeing a dramatic increase in transmission outside China” the World Health Organization’s emergency measures director Mike Ryan said on Thursday.

Ryan also said the main U.N. health agency expected the rest of a special WHO team to arrive in China over the coming weekend to investigative the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.

CHINA DEATH TOLL CLIMBING

In central China’s Hubei province officials said 242 people died on Wednesday the biggest daily rise since the flu-like virus emerged in the provincial capital Wuhan in December.

Total deaths in China are 1367.

The rise following a forecast earlier this week by China’s senior medical adviser that the epidemic may end there by April halted a global stocks rally.

But it appeared in large part to be due to methodology.

Hubei had previously only allowed infections to be confirmed by RNA tests which can take days. RNA or ribonucleic acid carries genetic information allowing identification of viruses.

But it has also begun using computerised tomography (CT) scans which give images of the lungs the Hubei health commission said to identify cases and isolate them faster.

As a result another 14840 new cases were reported in the province on Thursday up from 2015 new cases nationwide a day earlier. But excluding cases confirmed using the new methods the number of new cases rose by only 1508.

“It is our current understanding that the new case definition widens the net and includes not only lab-confirmed cases but also clinically diagnosed cases based on symptoms and exposure” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said.

The new method is only being used in Hubei and Jasarevic said the latest numbers from the province included retrospectively diagnosed cases.

About 60000 people have been infected in total the vast majority of them in China.

“VIRUS MAY BE SLOWING”

Consultancy Capital Economics said the surge in deaths did not necessarily point to an acceleration in the spread of the outbreak but rather to a previous understatement.

“For now the latest figures don’t appear to undermine the recent tentative signs that the spread of the virus may be slowing” it said.

The outbreak believed to have emerged from a Wuhan market where wildlife was traded illegally has triggered a backlash against local leaders.

Provincial Communist Party boss Jiang Chaoliang was fired as secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee and Ma Guoqiang removed as party chief in Wuhan state media said. They were the two highest-profile officials to be axed since the outbreak.

Chinese scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary results are weeks away although WHO chiefs have cautioned a vaccine could take 18 months.

Zhang Dingyu head of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital asked patients who recovered from the virus to donate blood plasma so others could benefit from antibodies they have built up.

There was a happier ending for another cruise ship the MS Westerdam which docked in Cambodia after being barred from Guam Japan the Philippines Taiwan and Thailand over fears that one of its 1455 passengers and 802 crew might have the virus - even though none had tested positive.

Passengers clapped and cheered on arrival at sunset. Cambodia later said none of 20 passengers from the ship who had b

NUUS HOOFTREKKE
President Cyril Ramaphosa lewer vanaand om seweuur sy vierde staatsrede en die tweede sedert sy verkiesing ná verlede jaar se algemene verkiesing. Verskeie ontleders meen Ramaphosa sal onder meer praat oor wyses om die sukkelende ekonomie op dreef te kry sowel as die stand van staatsinstellings en werkskepping. Hulle sê egter hy sal meer konkreet moet wees oor oplossings. Een van die kleiner partye die ATM het intussen n mosie van wantroue teen Ramaphosa by die speaker ingedien. Die EFF het gedreig dat hulle die staatsrede sal ontwrig indien die minister van Openbare Ondernemings Pravin Gordhan nie uit sy pos verwyder is nie.

Verskeie organisasies en vooraanstaande individue het hulle steun gegee aan die oproep van die Aartsbiskop van Kaapstad om vanjaar die Jaar van die Oranje Oorpakke te maak. Aartsbiskop Thabo Makgoba sê diegene wat by die plundering van staatshulpbronne betrokke was moet aangekla word. Verskeie sprekers by die gelelentheid het gesê staatskaping het die staat ontneem van die vermoë om dienste te lewer. Hulle sê die president moet hom in die staatsrede oor dié kwessie uitspreek. Die bestuurshoof van Sake-eenheid S.A Cas Coovadia sê as staatskapers vervolg word sal dit vertroue binnelands sowel as by buitelandse beleggers bevorder.

Amptenare stel ondersoek in wat die oorsaak is van gisteraand se treinongeluk by Horizon View in Roodepoort. Die langafstandpassasierstrein wat van Kaapstad na Johannesburg onderweg was het teen n goederetrein gebots. Een persoon is dood en talle is beseer. Nooddienspersoneel het onverpoosd gespook om vasgekeerde passasiers uit die wrak te bevry. Daar was n aantal buitelandse toeriste op die trein.

Eskom sê hy voorsien nie dat daar vandag beurtkrag sal wees nie. Die kragverskaffer het ook nie gister beurtkrag toegepas nie. Eskom sê eenhede wat buite werking was is suksesvol by die netwerk ingeskakel en noodreserwes is op aanvaarbare vlakke. Eskom het gewaarsku dat die kragnetwerk egter onder druk bly en dat beurtkrag op kort kennisgewing ingestel kan word.

BUITELAND
Daar is weer n skerp styging in die dodetal in die Hubei-provinsie in China wat die middelpunt is van die uitbreking van die Coronavirus. Nóg 242 sterftes is aangemeld wat die dodetal op meer as duisend 350 te staan bring. Die getal mense wat die virus het het met 15-duisend gestyg en bykans 60-duisend gevalle is reeds in aangemeld. Die Chinese gesondheidsowerhede het die definisie van gevalle egter aangepas en mense wat simptome toon maar nog nie positief getoets is nie word bygetel.

BEIJING
The Chinese province at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak reported a record rise in the death toll on Thursday under a new diagnostic method and Beijing sacked two local leaders after criticism of their handling of the crisis.

Health officials in Hubei province said 242 people had died from the flu-like virus on Wednesday the fastest rise in the daily count since the pathogen was identified in December and bringing the total number of deaths in the province to 1310. The previous highest daily rise in the toll was 103 on Feb. 10.

Reports in state-run media said provincial Communist Party boss Jiang Chaoliang had been sacked as secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee and Ma Guoqiang had been removed as party chief in the provincial capital Wuhan.

The reports did not state a reason for the dismissals but the two are the most high-profile Chinese officials to date to be removed from duty following the coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan late last yet.

Thank you Communist Party. It should have been done earlier Wuhan resident Wang You told Reuters.

Dozens of low-level health officials across the country have also lost their jobs for failing to contain the spread of the epidemic which is believed to have emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan where wildlife was traded illegally.

The spike in the death toll came a day after China had reported its lowest number of new cases in two weeks bolstering a forecast by the countrys senior medical adviser that the epidemic could end by April.

Another 14840 cases were reported in Hubei alone on Thursday from 2015 nationwide a day earlier after provincial officials started using computerised tomography (CT) scans to look for signs of the virus.

Hubei had previously only allowed infections to be confirmed by RNA tests which can take days to process. RNA or ribonucleic acid carries genetic information allowing for identification of organisms like viruses.

Using quicker CT scans that reveal lung infections would help patients receive treatment as soon as possible and improve their chances of recovery the Hubei health commission said.

The new diagnostic procedure could explain the spike in the death toll according to Raina McIntyre head of biosecurity research at the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.

Presumably there are deaths which occurred in people who did not have a lab diagnosis but did have a CT. It is important that these also be counted she told Reuters.

The new testing methodology is only being used in Hubei province so far Chinese officials said.

MARKETS RATTLED

Asian stock markets wobbled and the safe-havens of the Japanese yen gold and bonds rose after the new Hubei numbers dashed hopes the epidemic was stabilising and the Chinese economy could bounce back quickly.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday the number of cases of infection in China had stabilized but it was too early to say the epidemic was slowing.

This outbreak could still go in any direction WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a briefing in Geneva.

Experts say a vaccine could still be months away.

The latest toll from Hubei pushes the number of deaths in mainland China past 1350 with about 60000 confirmed cases.

Hundreds of infections have been reported in more than two dozen other countries and territories but only two people have died from the virus outside mainland China - one in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines.

The biggest cluster of cases outside China is on a cruise ship quarantined off the Japanese port of Yokohama where a further 44 cases were reported on Thursday. So far 219 of about 3700 people on board have tested positive.

There was a happy ending for another cruise ship the MS Westerdam which docked in Cambodia after being denied docking rights in Thailand Japan Taiwan Guam and the Philippines over fears one of its 1455 passengers and 802 crew might have the virus even though none had tested positive.

This morning just seeing land was such a breathtaking moment Angela Jones an American tourist on the ship told Reuters. I thought: Is this real?

Wuhan a city of 11 million people remains under virtual lockdown and other major Chinese cities are facing severe travel restrictions.

United Airlines said it would extend cancellations of all U.S. flights to China through late April meaning all U.S. passenger carriers flying to China had now cancelled flights into late April.

The move is the latest disruption to international travel that has paralysed businesses and played havoc with major conferences and sporting events.

The Mobile World Congress an annual telecoms industry gathering that draws more than 100000 visitors to Barcelona was cancelled on Wednesday after a mass exodus by exhibitors due to coronavirus-related concerns.

Dr Li Wenliang 33 died in a hospital in Wuhan.

He was one of eight people who tried to warn about the novel coronavirus when it first emerged in Wuhan now the epic enter of the disease but was reprimanded by local police.

The doctors death triggered an outpouring of millions of comments on Chinas social media sites as well as concern from the international community.

We are deeply saddened by the passing of Dr Li Wenliang twitted the World Health Organization (WHO). We all need to celebrate work that he did on 2019nCoV.

On Dec 30 Li an ophthalmologist at the Central Hospital of Wuhan warned in the online chat group WeChat that he had seen a report that showed positive test results of SARS for seven patients.

On Jan 3 Li and the seven others were summoned by Wuhan police for spreading fake information on the internet.

Li continued his work at the hospital until Jan 10 when he came down with a cough and fever symptoms of the coronavirus.

I was finally confirmed as being infected by the novel coronavirus Li wrote on Feb 1 on Weibo adding a dog emoji. The post got more than 1.6 million thumbs-ups and over 400000 netizens expressed their best wishes to him.

On Thursday evening several Weibo posts said Li had died from the novel coronavirus and they went viral on social media sparking immense sorrow and outrage of netizens.

At 12:38 am on Friday the Central Hospital of Wuhan denied Li had died.

Doctor Li was unfortunately infected by the novel coronavirus and he is now critically ill and under emergency treatment said the hospital on its official Weibo account.

The post soon attracted millions of netizens to pray for the doctor.

I wont sleep tonight!!! Wait for a miracle online! said one comment that received 350000 thumbs-up.

Comments that received tens of thousands of thumbs-up included: Please! Save him!  and I am waiting for a miracle for medicine for emergency treatment and for a hero!

The large number of comments including prayers ended sharply when Lis death was officially announced.

The highest level of court in China Supreme People’s Court is expected to give an approval on Friday for the mass killing of coronavirus patients in China as sure means of controlling the spread of the deadly virus.

The State tells the court that China is on the verge of losing its health workers to Coronavirus as at least 20 health workers contract the virus daily.

The State argues that coronavirus patients admitted at hospitals only have their deaths delayed and infect many others while receiving care at the hospital.

China has been under criticism for human rights violations and organizations have questioned China’s approach in dealing with the Coronavirus outbreak and it is believed the country has already killed many of its coronavirus patients.

The State mentioned in a document to the court that the country may lose its entire citizens if the few affected patients do not sacrifice their lives to save health workers and a billion others as there is no hope in sight in the fight against the virus.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it needs $1 billion to fight coronavirus outside China.

Countries around the world are starting to cut ties with China and pull their citizens out of the crisis-hit Hubei region where the virus emerged in the city of Wuhan.

Hong Kong’s leader today held a press conference during which she wore a face mask and said the city would stop all high-speed trains and ferries to the mainland halve the number of flights and stop giving visas to visitors from China.

The grim optional appendage marginal note came a day after China had reported its lowest number of association coronavirus cases in two weeks bolstering a forecast by the countrys senior medical assistant that the epidemic could decrease by April.

But the 2015 added avowed cases reported in mainland China regarding Wednesday were dwarfed by the 14840 totaling cases reported in Hubei alone harshly Thursday after provincial officials started using computerized tomography (CT) scans to see for infections.
Hubei had back single-handedly allowed infections to be acknowledged by RNA tests which can resign yourself to days to process and defer treatment. RNA or ribonucleic spiteful carries genetic opinion allowing for identification of organisms bearing in mind viruses.

Using CT scans that sky lung infections would yet to be occurring patients do treatment gone practicable and calculation happening their chances of recovery the Hubei health commission said.

Presumably there are deaths which occurred in people who did not have a lab diagnosis but did have a CT. It is important that these in addition to be counted she told Reuters.
Under previous stricter rules for identifying coronavirus cases patients were often denied access to treatment or went undiagnosed.

The substitute laboratory analysis methodology is without help monster used in Hubei province for that defense in the estrange and wide Chinese officials said.

February 13 2020 18:47
BEIJING (Feb 13): The Chinese province at the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak reported a record rise in deaths and thousands more cases on Thursday under a new diagnostic method raising fresh questions about the scale of the crisis.

The sharp rise in the headline number of deaths and infections unnerved world markets as traders halted a recent rally in stocks and retreated back to the safety of government bonds and gold.

Health officials in Chinas central province of Hubei said 242 people had died from the flu-like virus on Wednesday the fastest rise in the daily count since the pathogen was identified in December.

That took total deaths in China from the newly discovered virus to 1367 up 254 from the previous day the National Health Commission said.

The spike in numbers came a day after markets were cheered when China reported its lowest number of new cases in two weeks bolstering a forecast by the countrys senior medical adviser that the epidemic could end by April.

Hubei had previously only allowed infections to be confirmed by RNA tests which can take days to process. RNA or ribonucleic acid carries genetic information allowing for identification of organisms like viruses.

But it has begun using quicker computerised tomography (CT) scans which reveal lung infections the Hubei health commission said to confirm virus cases and isolate them faster.

As a result another new 14840 cases were reported in the central province on Thursday from 2015 new cases nationwide a day earlier. But excluding cases confirmed using the new methods the number of new cases rose by only 1508.

About 60000 people have now been confirmed to have the virus the vast majority of them in China.

The new diagnostic procedure could explain the spike in deaths said Raina McIntyre head of biosecurity research at the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales.

Presumably there are deaths which occurred in people who did not have a lab diagnosis but did have a CT she told Reuters. It is important that these also be counted.

The new testing is only being used in Hubei officials said.

*TENTATIVE SLOWING?*

Under the new system suspected cases were being confirmed and if the number of deaths did not rise as fast that would mean the disease was less deadly than thought said Dr Eyal Leshem of the Tel Aviv University School of Medicine.

The real mortality rate of the disease may be lower Leshem said.

Consultancy Capital Economics said the surge did not necessarily point to an acceleration in the spread of the virus but rather that official figures had been understating its prevalence.

For now the latest figures dont appear to undermine the recent tentative signs that the spread of the virus may be slowing it said.

Frank Benzimara head of Asia Equity Strategy at Society Generale in Hong Kong said the new figures had not sparked panic in financial markets: It can be seen as an exercise of transparency.

The outbreak which is believed to have emerged late last year from a market in Wuhan where wildlife was traded illegally is one of the biggest tests facing the Chinese government in years and blame has fallen on provincial leaders.

State media said provincial Communist Party boss Jiang Chaoliang had been sacked as secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee and Ma Guoqiang had been removed as party chief in the provincial capital Wuhan.

*CRUISE TO CAMBODIA*

Media did not give a reason for the dismissals but the two are the most high-profile officials to be removed from duty since the outbreak began.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday the number of infections in China had stabilised but it was too early to say the epidemic was slowing.

Chinese scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary clinical trial results are weeks away but a vaccine could take 18 months to develop.

Hundreds of infections have been reported in more than two dozen other countries and territories but only two people have died from the virus outside mainland China — one in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines.

The biggest cluster of cases outside China is on a cruise ship quarantined off the Japanese port of Yokohama where a further 44 cases were reported on Thursday. In all 219 of about 3700 people on board have tested positive.

There was a happy ending for another cruise ship the MS Westerdam which docked in Cambodia after being denied docking rights in Guam Japan the Philippines Taiwan and Thailand over fears that one of its 1455 passengers and 802 crew might have the virus even though none had tested positive.

The system doesn’t need more than a mobile phone number to work because technically it can access data stored by mobile phone carriers to determine both the past and the current locations of a device. No physical access to the device is required and no cloud data is necessary.  The system automatically collects location information when the device connects to a cell tower so from a technical perspective it is capable of determining things like your address where you work where you go on vacation and even see your route based on the logged data. Based on all of these anyone with access to such information can easily create a profile for any individual essentially being able not only to track calls but also to see when and where they’re going.  Map this and you get an accurate picture of one’s activity especially after tracking such information for a longer period of time as patterns could help determine very accurate information…

The teen decided she did not want to visit Mukherjee’s clinic again but was anxious to secure the video clip so she went to his clinic for the third time.

STUART TO HAVE SAY –After two years of silence former Prime Minister Freundel Stuart will be defending the stewardship of his Democratic Labour Party (DLP) administration which was swept out of office 30-0 by the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) in the May 24 2018 General Election. Stuart last engaged the nation when he conceded defeat on that night. When contacted by the NATION Stuart said he was still crystallising his thoughts but stressed that he would be addressing allegations the country was mismanaged between 2008 and 2018. He will address DLP faithful at a St Philip North branch meeting on Sunday at Princess Margaret Secondary School. “Really? Did this really happen? I will be taking a retrospective look at the ten years under the DLP and compare that to what is happening now” he said. When pressed further Stuart declined to give details. Since being ousted the DLP has yet to announce candidates for the next election constitutionally due in 2023. The party was dealt another blow when former minister in Stuart’s administration Donville Inniss was found guilty last month of three charges of money laundering in the United States. (DN)

BLP BUILDING A DYNASTY – Staunch Democratic Labour Party (DLP) member Derek Alleyne is challenging fellow party members and the media to speak out on issues affecting the population. Accusing Prime Minister Mia Mottley of “building a dynasty” Alleyne told party supporters he was disappointed that Barbadians were falling victim to Barbados Labour Party (BLP) “propaganda”. “I have chosen to deal with the Barbados Labour Party and its mission to create a Barbados in an image that will serve its own cause and that cause is to lift Mia Amor Mottley to hero status” he told the gathering at a St James South branch meeting at Queen’s College on Sunday night. “Yes some people have raised their voices in concern about the steps being taken but in my view they are missing the mark. Mottley is building a dynasty not a legacy and Barbadians are helping her. “  I say dynasty and not legacy for a simple understanding of legacy determines that it is a gift or a record but dynasty means much more” he contended. Alleyne charged that there were several “glaring quiet zone offences” that the BLP was guilty of but Barbadians were remaining silent on these. He identified some of those areas as the largest cabinet in the history of the country an amendment to the Constitution in order to appoint some senators the high murder rate last year the amount of money the island was now borrowing the high level of taxation and the retrenchment of public servants under the Barbados Economic Recovery and Transformation (BERT) plan. “But as we sit here new men and women have been hired in the debushing programme” he said. Alleyne who called on DLP members last August to stop feeling sorry for themselves said while he understood the DLP still had some housekeeping matters to attend to following its humiliating defeat in the last election it was critical for members speak out on these and other issues. “Internally there are many challenges to overcome in the DLP and we need each other to mount that charge. However across Barbados the poor are crying. I have never seen so many people asking for help in my lifetime and from people you didn’t think would ask” said Alleyne. “With Mottley promising more layoffs and more taxes the road ahead may never have been travelled by Barbadians before. Good men and women are required to chart a path and many of us have demonstrated where our hearts and heads are. We have to move now before we make ourselves irrelevant. Above all the DLP’s voice must be heard and heard with conviction” he insisted. The loyal party supporter also accused media houses in Barbados of not being true gatekeepers. “As we meet now the media houses in Barbados are influenced by a Mottley array of propaganda. I speak not of the journalists who prepare reports and articles but the powerbrokers who sit in their armchairs and decide the fate of all Barbadians who do not share in the philosophy of the Mottley BLP. Like the Trump Republicans we now have a Mottley BLP” he said. Alleyne said he would “not be fooled” by a recent decision by Government to place a plaque at the St Lucy home of National Hero Errol Barrow adding: “Time will be sufficient for many discussions about the direction this country is taking and the extent to which the populace appears to have taken leave of its senses and is awaiting a saviour. “Political institutions need to stay relevant because when they cease to be a welcomed voice then the f

 Coronavirus: China wildlife trade ban ‘should be permanent’.

BEIJING-Campaigners have urged China to apply a permanent ban on the wildlife trade following the coronavirus outbreak.
Markets selling live animals are considered a potential source of diseases that are new to humans.

There has been speculation just such a market in Wuhan could have been the starting point for the outbreak.

China put a temporary ban on the trade in wildlife as one measure to control the spread of coronavirus but conservationists say it’s not enough.

They argue that in addition to protecting human health a permanent ban would be a vital step in the effort to end the illegal trading of wildlife.

Campaigners say that China’s demand for wildlife products which find uses in traditional medicine or as exotic foods is driving a global trade in endangered species.

More than 70% of emerging infections in humans are estimated to have come from animals particularly wild animals.

Experts with the World Health Organization (WHO) say there’s a high likelihood the new coronavirus came from bats. But it might have made the jump to a currently unknown animal group before humans could be infected.

Two critical software defects plagued Starliner test flight.

After failing to rendezvous with the International Space Station as planned during Starliner’s first orbital flight test in December last year an independent review carried out to determine what went wrong has found “two critical software defects” that were not detected ahead of flight despite multiple safeguards says a statement by the agency one of which could have had serious connotations for the spaceship during reentry.

Following Starliner’s troubled Orbital Flight Test (OFT) mission late last year a joint investigation team consisting of NASA and Boeing officials was established in January tasked with examining the primary issues that occurred during the test flight.

At the time of the incident it was revealed by mission officials that problems with Starliners onboard timer was behind the capsule consuming more fuel than anticipated thus preventing Starliner from docking with the space station.

Although engineers regained control of the situation and put the spacecraft into a safe orbit a further review of other critical components led engineers to uncover a “valve mapping software issue” within the Service Module (SM) Disposal Sequence said the agency in a teleconference on 7 February.

The service module contains the spacecrafts support systems and is supposed to detach prior to re-entry. Had the problem not been caught and fixed via a software patch before the spacecraft returned to Earth the cylindrical service module’s thrusters could have fired in the wrong sequence sending it back into the crew module and possibly triggering a problematic collision of the two components.

The thrusters uneven firing would cause the service module which is a piece of a cylinder to come away from the crew module and recontact or bump back into it Jim Chilton senior vice president for Boeing Space and Launch said during the teleconference adding that bad things can happen as a result of that eventuality.

While this anomaly was corrected in flight if it had gone uncorrected it would have led to erroneous thruster firing and uncontrolled motion during SM separation for deorbit with the potential for catastrophic spacecraft failure said Paul Hill a former flight director and member of NASAs Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel.

“While both errors could have led to risk of spacecraft loss the actions of the NASA-Boeing team were able to correct the issues and return the Starliner spacecraft safely to Earth” says the statement by NASA.

In addition to the two software issues a poor communications link which impeded the Flight Control team’s ability to command and control the vehicle also contributed to the problems Starliner faced on the test flight.

The investigative review team is still working to determine the exact cause of this interference but it appears to be associated with cell phone towers John Mulholland vice president and program manager of Boeings Starliner program said during the teleconference.

This latest failure from Boeing which is still reeling from two fatal crashes of its 737 Max aircraft has called into question the company’s safety procedures and as such the safety panel has recommended several reviews of the aerospace giant. The panel has a larger concern with the rigor of Boeings verification processes Hill said.

“We want to understand what the culture is at Boeing that may have led to that” said Douglas Loverro a senior NASA official adding that multiple errors also pointed to insufficient oversight by his agency.

NASA is reluctant to discuss the ultimate future of Starliner but said only after these assessments will NASA determine whether the spa

Facing a sudden epidemic there would always be a variety of people and voices. We can see a lot of topics about human weaknesses everywhere on the Internet and I think its better to share some meaningful (interesting) information with you. Thanks to my lovely assistant Jessica Hu who did the translation job below and she is one of the best Chinese young people I have met.
Two hospitals newly built in Wuhan to treat patients infected with the novel coronavirus——Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital which makeshift medical facility have a capacity of 1.000 and 1.500 beds were built in record 10 and 15 days. These are examples of how unbelievable Chinese speed is and what is possible when 1.4 billion people working and have their minds set in the same direction. Let us take Huoshenshan Hospital as an example to see how does a hospital can be built so quickly.
Firstly the Chinese government issued an urgent directive: a life-saving hospital with a capacity of 1000 beds has to be built in six days. Led by the China Construction Third Engineering Bureau Co. Ltd Wuhan Construction Wuhan Municipal Construction Group Co. Ltd. Wuhan Hanyang Municipal Construction Group Co. Ltd. and other enterprises participated in the construction. 7.500 builders and nearly 1.000 mechanical equipment were organized to be in place within 12 hours on the beach slope of 50000 square meters by the Zhiyin Lake in Wuhan.
Then within 78 minutes the engineering design and research institute of China IPPR International Engineering Co. Ltd. completed the hospitals design and construction drawings and submitted them to Wuhan CITIC Architectural Design Institute for review by Dr. Huang Xizhi a national survey and design master. Three hours later CITIC Architectural Design Institute convened 60 designers within one hour contacted hundreds of BIM designers from all over the country to participate in the design came up with the design scheme within 24 hours and then immediately negotiated with the construction unit to finalize the construction drawings.
At the same time Wuhan Airport Development Group quickly entered the site to start site leveling road and drainage works Several companies formed an emergency engineering team to be responsible for the construction of anti-seepage works sewage treatment and medical waste transfer facilities China Railway Construction Heavy Industry Corporation Limited quickly reinforced the aid to catch up with the time limit.
Meanwhile more than 260 power workers of the State Grid Corporation of China did continuous construction for 24 hours. Before January 31 two 10kV lines were relocated 24 box-type transformers were installed 8000 meters of power cables were laid and power transmission began on time.
Before the completion of the power cable laying Huizhou EVE Energy urgently provided a silent generator trolley to solve the emergency power supply problem of key equipment such as communication base stations.
Huawei China Mobile China Telecom China Unicom and other front and rear enterprises cooperated closely and cooperated in the battle. After the rapid completion of 5G signal coverage in 36 hours they also delivered cloud resources computing and storage equipment for core systems and built a remote consultation system.
A camera was set up behind the scene for live broadcast and tens of millions of cloud supervisors were summoned to watch the heavy machinery supported and protected by Sany Heavy Industry Co. Ltd. Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science and Technology Co. Ltd. and Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group 24 hours a day.
CNPC dispatched on-site fuel trucks requisitioned nearby gas stations to provide oil guarantee for the project site and provided instant noodles drinking water meeting venues and temporary toilets.
All production personnel of the Ezhou Power Plant of the China Three Gorges Corporation was stationed in the plant to provide a guarantee for power consumption in Wuhan.
China Railway Construction Expressway gave priority to the supplies of Huoshenshan hospital.
Many companies provided steel gypsum board keel cement fire-resistant coatings galvanized round steel rubber-plastic insulation materials 5.931 toilets and faucets fire alarms 3.500 sets of integrated housings ductile iron pipes building pipes 4.800 sets of steel components 50 sets of main control power equipment 2.000 valves.
Sinotrans Limited delivered food and COFCO donated grain and oil to provide three meals a day for thousands of workers this required Hubei Zhongbai Storage to join forces with Alibaba to build a contactless cash register supermarket in one day to provide convenient and safe supplies for workers and medical workers.

Here around North Texas school districts are beginning to close due to heavy absenteeism. Flu seems to be getting the blame. Whatever the Queen and I had the other day it wasn’t the flu. The Queen’s throat swab came back negative and I never really ran a temperature. But it knocked both of us down and we are just now getting back to our normal abnormal. Hope all the kiddoes get the medication they need and stay hydrated. Many of these school districts are in rural areas with very limited access to affordable health care. Poor kids in rural areas frequently have to just “tough it out.” The lack of rural health care is another problem we need to address here in Texas.

The coronavirus has surged again. Reporters aren’t sure if it is a “surge” or an improved reporting method. Chinese news folks that initially reported the outbreak and lack of medical facilities have been arrested or have disappeared. Meanwhile the WHO is becoming more concerned as cases continue to pop up worldwide. The Chinese economy specifically and the world’s economy are taking a hit. We’ll have to see if the new info will affect U.S. Markets. But in the final analysis it seems the virus has hit the free press as well as the population.

In addition Dumplin’ has started a purge of folks who are loyal to the Constitution rather than to him. The whole mess reminds me of the Tuesday Night Massacre under Nixon. Dumplin’s loyalists in Congress are supporting him regardless of the damage done to the country’s economy social fabric and judicial system. I suspect that when a Democrat is President again and it will happen they’ll be horrified when the Democrat takes advantage of the precedents set by Dumplin’. Yup what goes around comes around there girls and boys.

The Republicans have raised $60 million in January and have $200 million on hand for Dumplin’s reelection. That’s about how much Mighty Mike has in pocket cash. Bloomberg has outspent Dumplin’ on social media by millions. Bloomberg has spent $1 million a day on Facebook for the last two weeks. I have no idea how much the other Democratic candidates have raised. As far as the Democratic race goes Sanders is in the lead after Iowa and New Hampshire. Buttigieg is on his heels. Klobuchar finished third in New Hampshire. Followed by Warren and Biden. Bloomberg is popping up in the middle of the pack in national polls.

The real test will come soon. First both Nevada and South Carolina are very diverse and we will see who captures the African American and Latino votes. Without these two blocks the Democratic candidate has little chance of winning the election. In addition Super Tuesday will give an even better picture of who supports whom and for what reasons. Last I time I checked Yang and three other candidates have dropped out. Nationally the polls are showing Sanders Biden Bloomberg Warren Buttigieg Klobuchar. IMC supports blue no matter who. 

And now some Quickies. Boris Johnson begins to clean out his Cabinet. Judge orders restoration of Immigration hot line. Senate to pass War Powers Act to limit Dumplin’s independent power on attacking Iran. Probably won’t be able to overcome a veto. Barr to testify before the House. Ethiopia passes anti hate speech and disinformation law. EU cold to Pompeo’s advances. GOP lawmakers propose the planting of trillions of trees to suck carbon dioxide out of the air. Given their success regarding the President they are probably the American experts on sucking. Judge dismisses Stones’ request for dismissal. Federal Judges are still appointed for life and immune to presidential bullying.  American personal debt hits 12 year high. Turkey threatens Syria. Duarte kick U.S. out. North Texas schools beginning to close due to the flu or something. Pollen counts to rise in North Texas. Spanx to start featuring Donald Trump in their new Bodysuit ads. Just kidding maybe. 

I’ve noticed some anti-Democratic Party trolls are beginning to turn up here on the page.  They seem bent on attacking Party leaders and yellow dog Democrat groups. I don’t believe they are Republicans. As long as these folks aren’t abusive or promote outright lies they are welcome to share their opinions. Nothing sharpens one’s beliefs like an open discussion. 

The Queen and I along with some other SD-22 and TX 25 Democrats will be headed down to Cleburne to at

LA MAFIA KHAZAR UTILISE LA PEUR PANIQUE DU VIRUS DANS UNE TENTATIVE DÉSESPÉRÉE DE MAINTENIR SON CONTRÔLE SUR PLUS DE 200 « ÉTATS-NATIONS ». BENJAMIN FULFORD

La Mafia Khazar lutte pour sa survie en répandant la peur panique d’une pandémie virale dans une tentative désespérée de maintenir sa grille de contrôle sur l’humanité selon de multiples sources. La raison en est qu’ils ne peuvent respecter les échéances de paiement (provisoirement étendues à février) de leur société des Etats-Unis d’Amérique affirment les sources participant aux négociations. Un des buts des négociations est de restaurer la souveraineté du peuple et la République des Etats Unis d’Amérique. Il va également en résulter la divulgation du programme spatial secret ajoutent-elles. 

Nous allons en parler plus en détail par la suite mais d’abord examinons le coup de la pandémie l’ultime stratagème de survie de la cabale. Comme le savent la plupart de nos lecteurs il est hautement improbable que l’éruption du « Coronavirus » en Chine ait été d’origine naturelle. Il existe de nombreux indices que cette pandémie ait été planifiée à l’avance dans le cadre d’une tentative d’extorsion d’argent de la Chine pour financer la société des Etats-Unis.

Tout d’abord il y a eu une offensive systématique sur tous les sites internet qui publient des nouvelles supprimées par les médias des conglomérats de propagande. Par exemple Natural News qui a révélé depuis longtemps les scandales liés aux vaccins a été fermé. Jimstone Freelance a également été frappé plus durement que d’habitude. D’autres journalistes ont été victimes d’accusation criminelles fictives.

Ce site a également été victime d’une grave agression. Notre ancien webmaster a soudainement perdu l’esprit et a montré des signes d’un grave empoisonnement à la PCP*. Puis il « s’est suicidé ». Par la suite nous avons été privés d’accès à notre propre site avant que les casquettes blanches de la NSA ne nous aident à le récupérer. Nous subissons également de sérieuses attaques financières.

Ces attaques ont précédé de peu l’éruption de la pandémie du coronavirus qui a bénéficié d’une couverture jusqu’à saturation de panique sensationnaliste de la part des médias privés. En plus d’être du chantage cela ressemble à une tentative pour réintroduire de la peur et de la haine dans le récit prédominant de notre discours public. 

Il semble bien qu’ils aient procédé à une répétition le 18 octobre 2019 lorsqu’un exercice a été organisé aux Etats-Unis pour simuler une pandémie et un effondrement économique consécutif. Les sponsors de cet évènement étaient le Forum Economique Mondial (Davos) la Fondation Bill et Melinda Gates et l’Ecole de Santé Publique Bloomberg de l’Université Johns Hopkins. En d’autres termes la Cabale Centrale. Puis au même moment où le Forum Economique Mondial tenait sa réunion annuelle à Davos du 21 au 24 janvier 2020 une véritable pandémie s’est déclenchée en bénéficiant d’une publicité sans égale.

La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) declaró el 30 de enero la epidemia de emergencia de salud pública de interés internacional. En los últimos días los líderes de varios países y los jefes de muchas organizaciones internacionales han mostrado sus sentimientos de apoyo a la lucha de China contra la epidemia y han proporcionado generosamente ayuda como suministros médicos muy necesarios.

Sin embargo altos funcionarios y medios de comunicación de algunos países occidentales han ignorado los enormes esfuerzos de China para combatir la epidemia y han lanzado ataques contra el país. Sus actos ignoran los hechos y son extremadamente inmorales tal como lo describe un proverbio chino: “arrojar piedras sobre alguien que ha caído en un pozo”.

Los grandes desastres son la prueba más severa de la naturaleza humana. Las violaciones de los derechos humanos contra los chinos incluso las personas de aspecto asiático como la discriminación racial y el rechazo a la entrada en una frontera merecen la vigilancia de la comunidad internacional.

Las enfermedades infecciosas que pueden estallar en cualquier región de cualquier nación son el enemigo común de la humanidad. Folke Henschen autor de Historia y Geografía de las Enfermedades dijo una vez que la historia humana también es la historia de las enfermedades. En la historia humana la viruela la peste el cólera la lepra la tuberculosis el sarampión la rabia la malaria la fiebre amarilla y otras enfermedades infecciosas han representado una gran amenaza para los humanos.

La peste de Atenas (430BC-427BC) devastó la ambiciosa ciudad-estado de Atenas. La peste antonina (165AD-180AD) mató a casi un tercio de la población del Imperio Romano. La peste negra que estalló en 1347 se extendió por Europa resultando en la muerte de aproximadamente 25-30 millones de personas. Antes de que fuera erradicada la viruela plagó a la humanidad durante al menos 3.000 años. En el siglo XVIII el número de europeos que murieron de viruela se estimó en más de 150 millones. Y solo en el siglo XX la viruela se llevó la vida de más de 300 millones de personas.

Se estima que el número de muertos por la pandemia de influenza de 1918 alcanzó los 50 millones mientras que la Primera Guerra Mundial causó la muerte de unos 40 millones. El brote del virus de la Influenza A subtipo H1N1 en México y Estados Unidos en marzo de 2009 duró más de un año afectando a 214 países y regiones y causando aproximadamente 284.500 muertes. En 2014 la enfermedad por el virus del Ébola se extendió a varios países en solo unos meses matando a más de 7.000 personas en África occidental. Las enfermedades infecciosas han matado a más personas que las guerras y los desastres naturales.

Para combatir las enfermedades infecciosas la humanidad ha seguido mejorando la tecnología médica y el saneamiento público lo que ha garantizado la seguridad de la salud y ha promovido el progreso científico y tecnológico. En este sentido la lucha contra las enfermedades especialmente las enfermedades infecciosas es una de las fuerzas impulsoras en el desarrollo de la civilización humana. Se pueden encontrar informes sobre la inoculación contra la viruela en China a finales del siglo X y el procedimiento se practicó ampliamente en el siglo XVI.

A finales del siglo XVIII el médico británico Edward Jenner creó y promovió la vacuna contra la viruela que frenó en gran medida el posible brote del virus y redujo la tasa de mortalidad. En 1928 el bacteriólogo británico Alexander Fleming descubrió la penicilina un poderoso fármaco antibacteriano que puso fin a la era en que las enfermedades infecciosas eran incurables. En 1972 el científico chino Tu Youyou extrajo con éxito artemisinina para el tratamiento de la malaria que ha salvado millones de vidas en todo el mundo especialmente en los países en vías de desarrollo. Tu Youyou recibió el Premio Nobel de Fisiología o Medicina en 2015.

Desde el siglo XVIII algunos países europeos han tomado la delantera en la construcción de instalaciones de saneamiento urbano mejorando los sistemas de agua y alcantarillado así como centralizando el tratamiento y la desinfección de residuos. Todas estas medidas han evitado eficazmente enfermedades infecciosas como la peste. En los tiempos modernos los esfuerzos concertados de la comunidad internacional han erradicado algunas enfermedades infecciosas que alguna vez fueron rampantes. Por ejemplo la Organización Mundial de la Salud anunció en diciembre de 1979 que el mundo estaba libre del virus de viruela.

La epidemia en curso de neumonía provocada con el nuevo coronavirus es otro ejemplo de enfermedades infecciosas que ha alarmado a la humanidad. Ante esta importante emergencia de salud pública el Pa

He was the doctor who discovered the novel coronavirus and in the early morning of 7 Feb 2:58AM he was promoted into glory and went home to be with our Father in heaven. 

Back in December last year he was arrested for being a whistle blower spreading rumors about a mysterious pneumonia like virus. This morning we found out he was in fact a fellow brother in Christ. Our hearts are deeply moved by his sacrificial choice to spread awareness about the virus despite the risks he faced especially to his reputation and to his own health. 

He continued to care for patients up until he was infected himself. What a legacy to leave behind of what it means to be like Jesus to those hurting in a time of crisis. 
He chose to be an example of Immanuel God with us to the people of Wuhan. 
Can you imagine the joy he must have felt as he entered into eternity and heard the words Well done my good and faithful servant? 

So today please pray for his family especially his wife who is also infected and 8 months pregnant with their second child. May God heal them supernaturally and give them grace peace strength and comfort during this time.

Dr Li Wen Liang penned a deeply touching Chinese poem below of how he would miss his family his beloved Wuhan and quoted 2 Tim 4:7-8 ‘I have fought the good fight I have finished the race I have kept the faith’. Finally there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous Judge will give to me on that Day and not to me only but also to all who have loved His appearing.

The Hero Who Told The Truth

Here is a captivating heart-touching Chinese poem written in memory of Mr Li Wenliang a Christian doctor and whistleblower who died from the coronavirus himself after being punished for issuing the first warning about the deadly coronavirus outbreak.

I dont want to be a hero.
I still have my parents
And my children
And my pregnant wife whos about to give birth
And many of my patients in the ward.
Though my integrity cannot be exchanged for the goodness of others
Despite my loss and confusion
I should proceed anyway.
Who let me choose this country and this family?
How many grievances do I have?
When this battle is over
I will look up to the sky
With tears like rain.

With their hope of life.

I have my new house there
For which I still have to pay off the loan every month.
How can I give up?
How can I give up?
For my parents without their son
How sad must it be?
For my sweetheart without her husband 
How can she face the vicissitudes in her future?

The Wuhan Institute of Virology - based in the central Chinese city at the epicentre of the epidemic - has applied for a patent in China for the use of the antiviral drug known as remdesivir in treating the ailment. The application was made on Jan 21 along with a military academy according to a Feb 4 statement on the institutes website.

The move is a sign that China wants more say over a drug it deems as one of the most promising candidates against the infection that has killed almost 500 people. The decision to seek a patent instead of invoking the heavy-handed compulsory licence option that lets nations override drug patents in national emergencies underscores the delicate balancing act before China as it signals commitment towards intellectual property rights alongside curbing the virus outbreak.","866942750151725_1380019025510759","instagramlavakaflenepal"

 The economic casualties from China’s coronavirus epidemic are mounting as Asian and European auto plants run short of parts free-spending Chinese tourists stay home and American companies brace for unpredictable turbulence.

That’s just the start of a financial hangover that is expected to linger for months even if the flulike illness is soon brought under control economists and supply chain experts say. The Chinese epidemic’s aftereffects will probably cause the global economy to shrink this quarter for the first time since the depths of the 2009 financial crisis according to Capital Economics in London.

Chinese factories had been scheduled to reopen Feb. 10 after a Lunar New Year holiday that had been extended for several days because of the medical scare. But with many workers unable or unwilling to return to employers located in a sprawling quarantine region the resumption of routine operations in many workplaces has been delayed.
Caterpillar this week said most of its Chinese suppliers have returned to work. But Foxconn a major electronics producer for Apple said it will be the end of the month before even half of its facilities are operating.

The country’s links to the outside world meanwhile remain frayed. United Airlines and American Airlines said this week that they would not resume normal service to mainland China until April 24 almost a month later than planned.

The ripple effects of China’s shutdown are spreading with the auto industry especially hard-hit. Nissan temporarily closed one of its factories in Japan after running short of Chinese components one week after Hyundai in South Korea did the same. Fiat Chrysler warned that it may shutter one of its European plants. Some U.S. manufacturers could face parts shortages in one to two weeks.

“I worry that it’s going to be a bigger deal than most economists are treating it as right now” said Mohamed El-Erian chief economic adviser at Allianz the German financial services company. “It will take time to restart all these economic engines.”

About 5100 cases of covid-19 were confirmed in China on Thursday and 121 more people died Chinese health officials said Friday morning. Most of the new cases and deaths continued to be in Hubei province.
More than 63000 confirmed cases and approximately 1380 deaths have been reported in China since the outbreak began.

In the United States the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday reported the 15th coronavirus case an individual who had been in quarantine in Texas since arriving on a State Department-chartered aircraft from Wuhan on Feb. 7. And Japan reported its first coronavirus death. It also said 44 more people had tested positive for the illness aboard the quarantined cruise liner Diamond Princess bringing to 218 the number of ship-borne infections.

The coronavirus struck China as many U.S. corporations were reconsidering their global footprints. President Trump’s tariffs on roughly 70 percent of all Chinese goods imposed during a two-year trade war with Beijing raised doubts about the future of trans-Pacific supply lines.

“We were already hitting the pause button on globalization” El-Erian said. “This virus disrupts the movement of goods and it disrupts the movement of people making companies reassess how international they want their supply chains to be.”

After initially dismissing the epidemic as principally a Chinese problem U.S. policymakers in recent days acknowledged it will damage the global and U.S. growth outlooks. Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell said this week that there will “very likely be some effects on the United States” from the epidemic which has closed thousands of Chinese factories that supply American companies.

Oil Markets Bounce Back As Coronavirus Fears Fade

By OILPRICE dot COM

It seems that oil markets have decided that the coronavirus worst-case scenario that sent prices below the $50 mark is increasingly unlikely with WTI now moving back up towards $52.

Friday February 14th 2020

Oil prices rebounded in the second half of this week as markets eyed progress in China on the coronavirus. “The market is getting more comfortable that we’ve hit the bottom” Rebecca Babin a senior equity trader at CIBC Private Wealth Management told Bloomberg. “Oil markets have discounted the worst case and could show more resilience as long as cases outside of China are not spiking.”

Gas writedowns reach Europe. The U.S. shale gas industry revealed more writedowns this week when they reported fourth-quarter earnings as the financial pressure continues to mount with Nymex prices under $2MMBtu. Range Resources (NYSE: RRC) and Gulfport Energy (NASDAQ: GFOP) were downgraded by Sander Piper. Noble Energy (NSYE: NBL) took a $1.1 billion writedown and Occidental (NYSE: OXY) took a $1.7 billion write down. The impairments stretched to Europe where Centrica (LON: CNA) took a $1.4 billion writedown.

IEA: Demand will contract in 1Q. The IEA not only revised down its full-year 2020 oil demand forecast but it also said that first quarter consumption would contract by over 400000 bpd the first year-on-year contraction in more than a decade. The agency said that the market remains in flux and predicted a steadying of the supplydemand balance in the second half of the year.

Nigeria’s oil could fall by 35 percent. Nigeria’s oil production could decline by 35 percent in the next ten years due to regulatory uncertainty high costs and low prices.

Capital drying up for E&Ps. E&Ps are under intense financial pressure and rising investor scrutiny. They face long-term peak oil demand and short-term struggles with profitability. “There may well be too few ‘quality’ competitive investment opportunities for the E&P industry as a whole parts of the industry will not be able to attract investment capital” said Jerry Kepes Keith King and Siddhartha Sen of IHS Markit.

BP outlines energy transition. BP (NYSE: BP) said that it would cut emissions from its operations to zero by 2050 while also cutting scope 3 emissions – those that result from the end-consumer burning fuels – in half. It’s an ambitious plan one that tries to position the oil major as a leader not a laggard in the fight against climate change. It may also put additional pressure on the American oil majors – Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) – to step up climate commitments.

Exxon cuts employee travel. ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) cut back on employee travel an unusual austerity drive that comes shortly after the company posted its worst quarterly result in years.

Virginia votes to phase out coal. The state house and senate in Virginia passed legislation this week that would target 100 percent renewable energy by 2045 or 2050 (each chamber passed different versions). The legislation calls for a partial coal phase out by 2024 and for the remainder by 2030. It also incentivizes offshore wind.

Shell EDP set record-low offshore wind cost. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS.A) and EDP Renovaveis SA agreed to sell power from an offshore wind farm they are building in the Atlantic Ocean for a record-low price. The project in the waters of Massachusetts would supply electricity for $58MWh.

EIA: U.S. coal output to fall 13.7 percent. The EIA says that U.S. coal production will fall 13.7 percent this year.

Permian gas flaring worse than thought. According to new research from Rystad Energy the rate of flaring in the Permian basin is much worse than previously thought. Gas flaring reached 810 million cubic feet per day up 190 mcfd after including data from gas processing facilities.

Investors back away from oil sands. BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) said this week that one of its green-oriented funds would no longer invest in companies that operate in Alberta’s oil sands. “If you look at how destructive oil sands can be there’s a very strong rationale” Armando Senra head of BlackRock’s iShares Americas funds told the NYT. They along with coal are “the worst offenders if you want from a climate perspective.”

Marathon cuts drilling budget as profits fall. Marathon Oil (NYSE: MRO) said that it would cut its drilling budget by 10 percent after it reported a $20 million loss in the fourth quarter.

WoodMac: Fracking ban hits 1.2 mbd. A study by Wood Mackenzie finds that a fracking ban on federal lands could cut into supply by as much as 1.2 mbd although less of an impact in the short run.

Among the first tangible effects in the United States is a decline in the number of Chinese tourists. Visitors from China represent a lucrative market for U.S. airlines hotels luxury retailers and entertainment venues with average spending of about $6500 per person. As of Feb. 7 the number of passengers flying between North America and China was 75 percent below last year’s level and was shrinking by the day according to Quandl a financial data provider.

At Sino American Tours a Manhattan travel agency that caters to Chinese Americans bookings have plunged by 20 to 30 percent said Charles Man vice president for marketing. “Of course we’re impacted” he said. “A lot of people canceled trips back to Beijing Hong Kong Guangzhou Taiwan and Singapore.”

Chinese officials meanwhile are growing increasingly concerned that their efforts to contain the virus are strangling the economy. President Xi Jinping t

“The biggest problem is that health care workers who are taking care of sick patients dont have enough protective gear and this puts them at greater risk of catching the virus while theyre taking care of patients. From reports that Ive seen that seems to have created some panic among the group we call the ‘worried well.’ These people without symptoms but now dont have access to the protective equipment that the local government and public health officials said they should have.

Warren Buffett took a $1 billion loss after Kraft Heinz stock plunged 11% in two days this week.

Berkshire Hathaway’s 27% stake in the food giant shrank in value to $8.7 billion from $9.8 billion between Thursday and Friday.

Kraft Heinz reported sharp declines in fourth-quarter sales and profits on Thursday.

Fitch cut the credit rating on Kraft Heinz bonds to junk on Friday.

Warren Buffett lost more than $1 billion this week after Kraft Heinz stock plummeted 11% in two days.

The famed investor’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate owns about 27% of the food giant according to Bloomberg data. The value of its stake plunged to $8.7 billion from $9.8 billion between Thursday and Friday after a one-two punch of disappointing earnings and a credit-rating cut pummeled Kraft Heinz shares.

On Thursday the maker of Heinz ketchup and Kraft macaroni and cheese revealed a 5% drop in fourth-quarter net sales and a 14% slump in adjusted earnings per share. CEO Miguel Patricio said the performance was disappointing in a press release.

On Friday Fitch cut Kraft Heinz’s credit rating to BBB- from BB downgrading its bonds to non-investment grade or junk Bloomberg reported. The credit-rating agency cited the company’s large debt pile dwindling profits and negative outlook.

Kraft Heinz stock has nosedived almost 75% from its peak in February 2017 underscoring the magnitude of Buffett’s mistake.

The so-called Oracle of Omaha partnered with private-equity group 3G Capital to buy Heinz for about $28 billion on Valentine’s Day in 2013. The pair then cofinanced Heinz’s $50 billion mega-merger with Kraft Foods in 2015. Kraft-Heinz’s market capitalization is currently less than $33 billion.

We try to buy good businesses at a decent price and we made a mistake on the Kraft part of Kraft Heinz Buffett said at Berkshire’s annual meeting last year. We paid too much money.

Praise to the Goddess
Who Eliminates All Diseases (Parnashavari)

Out of the mandala of dharmakaya’s great bliss
You protect against dangerous diseases like epidemics
And against untimely death–
I pay homage to you the mother of wish-fulfilling activities. 
???????????????????????????????!

You golden-colored Parnashavari sit on a lotus seat
Your main face is yellow the right one blue and the left one white
Your hair is bound up in a topknot and you are full of splendor–
I pay homage to the divine body of the goddess granting accomplishments. 
???????????????????????????????!

You Illustrious One are the embodiment of wisdom and compassion
You stand in the midst of masses of fire burning like at the end of time
With your three faces and six arms you look terribly wrathful–
I pay homage to you whose one leg is stretched and the other bend. 
???????????????????????????????!

You who wears a robe of leaves hold bow and arrow
Battle ax and a bunch of branches.
Parnashavari you show the threatening mudra and hold a vajra–
I pay homage to you great mother protectress of beings. 
???????????????????????????????!

OM PI SHA TSI PARNA SHA WA RI SARVA MA RI PRA SHA MA NI HUNG

?????????????????????

By this virtue
may I swiftly accomplish Parnashavari
and establish all beings
without exception in her state.

Everyone should supplicate the deity. There are many different deities and we are told: “supplicate this deity” or “supplicate that deity.” Actually there is no difference between the deities. You should supplicate whichever deity you trust and have faith in.

 “All the buddhas are one within the expanse of primordial wisdom”. You should supplicate whichever deity you personally trust and have faith in.

 
In particular to whom you have connection apply the balm from the Gyanagma Prayer Wheel to the nose in the morning and evening. It will surely protect you. Further wearing these wristbands will also be of benefit. So mainly use the balm and take more blessing pills.

Praying for these who have fallen ill four disciples can gather to practice together or you can do practices online or you can practice at home by yourself. Visualize whichever Buddha you practice in the space before you and imagine that the light rays emanating from this Buddha pervade the entire world. In this way practice the deity while meditating on the immeasurable love. 

It doesn’t matter which deity you practice. Pray to whichever deity you have the greatest faith in. For this the World Peace Prayer is most important. Thus whatever practice you are doing together with it recite the World Peace Prayer often. So take the blessing pills continuously and apply the Gyanagma balm under your nose. This is important. I will also keep praying.

 
~~ WORLD PEACE PRAYER ~~

To the unfailing sources of refuge the Three Jewels and Three Roots and especially Chenrezig the protector of the Land of Snows to Noble Tara and Guru Padmasambhava I pray: please remember your sacred pledge of former times! Please grant blessings that this aspiration be entirely fulfilled!

In this dark age of decline the thoughts and actions of beings are corrupted and the balance of the outer and inner elements is lost. Through these causes and conditions

Newburyport Origins of the New World Order in America.

Excerpt

In 2012 Harvard University featured an exhibit entitled The China Trade. This manuscript re-examines this period from a local perspective during the creation and development of the most powerful and influential institutions in this country along with its first central banks that were directly tied to the triangular slave and drug trade (opium=heroin).

This manuscript continues to explore the alternative avenues of history that have been kept from the official history books and historical societies and re-discovers this countrys most influential characters that had their roots in Newburyport Massachusetts. They have formed our past and continues to shape our future.

People like Caleb Cushing and a vast network of relatives and associates including the Perkins Pierce (Franklin and Barbara (Bush) Pierce) and Forbes Family (John Kerry Forbes). Included as well is one of the most influential Master Masons Albert Pike (Harvard student at age 15 later taught at Newburyport High School) and his connections to the Scottish Rite. It is an elite secret society infiltration of not just our countrys governments...but the worlds.

This was the core of the New World Order in America. For example lets take a closer look at the present Secretary of State John Kerry and as previously pointed out John FORBES Kerry. Exactly who is the Forbes family?

From WikiPedia

The Forbes family is a wealthy extended American family long prominent in Boston Massachusetts. The familys fortune originates from trading between North America and China in the 19th century plus other investments in the same period. The name descends from Scottish immigrants and can be traced back to Sir John de Forbes in Scotland in the 12th century. Notable family members are businessman John Murray Forbes (1813–1898) part of the first generation who accumulated wealth and politician John Forbes Kerry (born 1943).
In other words

Fur trade paled and when hard cash grew harder to come by a search began for a substitute for the furs and specie that had been foundations of Bostons China trade. Opium seemed the ideal commodity. By the 1820s John Perkins Cushing (Caleb Cushings cousin) was known as the most influential of all the foreigners in Canton and had struck up a close relationship with the hong merchant Houqua who at his death in 1843 was said to be the richest man in the world.

 Trading between North America and China in the 19th century plus other investments in the same period = OPIUM TRADE. 
Remember the name Cushing as in Caleb Cushing. Newburyports very first mayor and the first U.S. Ambassador to....where?

CHINA

John Murray Forbes according to Wikipedia

John Murray Forbes (1813-1898) brother of Robert Bennet Forbes and the great-granduncle of 2004 presidential candidate John Forbes Kerry.

John Murray Forbes (February 23 1813 – October 12 1898) was an American railroad magnatemerchant philanthropist and abolitionist. He was president of both the Michigan Central railroad and the Chicago Burlington and Quincy Railroad in the 1850s.

His father Ralph Bennett Forbes was a member of the Forbes family who attempted unsuccessfully to start a trade from Bordeaux.1 His mother Margaret Perkins was the sister of Thomas Handasyd Perkins founder of a Boston Brahmin family merchant dynasty involved in the China trade.

Forbes was one of three brothers sent by their uncle to Canton China and achieved some financial success during a short time spent trading in Canton. However unlike his brother Robert Bennet Forbes who devoted himself to the China trade Forbes returned to Boston and became an early railroad investor and landowner. As with Jay Gould and E. H. Harriman Forbes was an important figure in the building of Americas railroad system. From March 28 1846 through 1855 he was president of Michigan Central Railroad and he was a director and president of the Chicago Burlington and Quincy Railroad he helped with the growth of the American Middle West.

Forbes founded J.M. Forbes & Co. an investment firm in Boston in 1838.1 

He supplied money and weapons to New Englanders to fight slavery in Kansas and in 1859 entertained John Brown.

His brother Robert Bennet Forbes
He was born in 1804 in Jamaica Plain Boston Massachusetts son of Ralph Bennet Forbes and Margaret Perkins and brother of Joh

Wall Street Breakfast: Surge In Coronavirus Cases Derails Stock Rally
Feb. 13 2020 6:14 AM ET

by Seeking Alpha:
Following global markets into the red U.S. stock index futures are pulling back from record highs - with the DJIA pointing to an opening loss of 200 points - ahead of earnings from Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Denting sentiment are 15000 new coronavirus infections in China that were calibrated using a new CT scan detection method rather than confirmation via slower ribonucleic acid tests. That brings the national total to just over 60000 cases prompting China to replace its top officials in the central province of Hubei and its capital Wuhan. While non-China deaths linked to COVID-19 still remain very low WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned the outbreak could still go in any direction.

Mobile World Congress is officially canceled

With swaths of individual companies pulling out of the exhibition over the past week the GSMA telecoms association that hosts the get-together has called off the Feb. 24-27 event. Fears over the coronavirus outbreak were to blame despite assurances from local and national health officials that it would have been safe to hold it. The Mobile World Congress draws more than 100000 visitors to Barcelona and is known as the years biggest event for the telecom industry.

Fresh tensions over Sprint takeover terms

Just when it looked like the deal was done the merger of Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is again in question. Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGY) the parent company of T-Mobile U.S. is pressing to renegotiate the terms of the takeover as the shares and performance of Sprint have deteriorated since the deal was announced sources told the FT. The move is opposed by Sprints controlling shareholder SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY) of Japan according to people close to its chairman Masayoshi Son. S -5.8% premarket.

Senate banking panel questions Fed nominees

The latest nominees to the Federal Reserve will face a crucial test at a Senate grilling today after the past two picks economist Stephen Moore and Herman Cain were rejected. Christopher Waller director of research at the St. Louis Fed is expected to easily pass muster though lawmakers will closely examine the views of Judy Shelton an adviser to the Trump campaign in 2016. She has a long history of unorthodox economic commentary like questioning the basic role of the Fed calling for near-zero interest rates and advocating for pegging the dollar to the gold standard.

More red ink in Washington

Fresh data from the Treasury Department showed the federal government post a budget deficit of $389.2B in the first four months of fiscal 2020. Thats a 25% gain over the same period last year and already about 40% of the total deficit for fiscal 2019. Tax receipts are actually on the rise comparatively but the rate of federal outlays is adding to the shortfall bringing the total national debt to $23.3T.

Euro hits weakest level since 2017

Worries about the European economy emerged on Wednesday as the euro fell to its weakest level against the dollar since 2017 dropping as much as 0.4% to $1.0877. On top of a weakened economy impacts from the coronavirus are likely to send Germany into recession while Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) expects to post a contraction in the fourth quarter. Also weighing on sentiment is a lingering succession battle at the top of the German government a slump in eurozone industrial output and fears about the financial health of Italy.

Barclays CEO probed over Epstein ties

Britains financial regulators are probing historical links between Barclays (NYSE:BCS) CEO Jes Staley and Jeffrey Epstein the disgraced financier who died in jail last year while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The NYT previously said that Epstein had referred dozens of wealthy clients to Staley when he ran JPMorgans (NYSE:JPM) private banking business while Staley visited Epstein in prison when he was serving a sentence between 2008-09 for soliciting prostitution. The news came as Barclays released annual results: Profit before tax rose 26% YY to £4.4B in 2019 though a cautious outlook was given for the year ahead.

The only time the idiot opens her trap is to talk racism crap or to attack Australia There is a hundred people dying a day with the  coronavirus providing they are telling the truth which I highly doubt and she is here talking crap. 

(Blow The Truth)
The Greens Senator Mehreen Faruqi making up Porky Pies (Lies) relating to Coronavirus Using the Old Lefty Words xenophobia and racism
I walk around the Streets in my Town full of Asian Restaurants Asian Massage Parlours and Asian People are walking the streets safely and I have not to Witness anyone even looking at an Asian or Calling out Racist Slurs. 

The Greens Senator Mehreen Faruqi Senate Speech: I want to acknowledge the extraordinary work of the agencies and experts around the world who are managing the response to the coronavirus outbreak. I acknowledge in particular the loved ones of those who are no longer with us and the medical staff caring for victims deserve our thanks. Despite the hysteria and terrible consequences of the virus both medical and social we can and will get through this.
The xenophobia and racism that has spread with the coronavirus is heartbreaking. For weeks now Chinese Australians and people of colour have had to endure everything from looks flinches and veiled comments to explicitly racist attacks and abuse. Theyve been told to avoid schools and universities and they feel forced to wear masks and suppress normal coughs.

In Sydney last week a young Asian-Australian mother on a train with her child was yelled at by another passenger for spreading viruses. Dr Nadia Alam a Canadian wrote on Twitter that her son was cornered at school by kids who wanted to test him for coronavirus—just because he is half Chinese. They chased him scared him and made him cry. In the UK one student was attacked for wearing a face mask and two others had eggs thrown at them. It has come to a point where a community group in the UK is now keeping lists of racist bullying incidents in schools linked to the coronavirus.
Australian doctors have reported that patients and staff in emergency departments have been subjected to racist abuse. In Albury Harvey Norman put up a sign which read No coronavirus in our mattresses as ours are Australian made. The Herald-Sun ran a headline reading Chinese virus pandamonium and The Daily Telegraphs China kids stay home was equally disgusting. Health authorities in New South Wales and Queensland have had to rebut racist hoaxes targeting Chinese communities. Weve seen needlessly empty seats at Chinese restaurants that would usually be busy. The situation is so bad that even Australias Chief Medical Officer has warned about racism saying Were very concerned about xenophobia and any sort of racial profiling which is completely abhorrent.

None of this is a natural or excusable response to the coronavirus. It is okay to worry but it is never okay to indulge xenophobes and fear-mongers who are exploiting this moment of panic. There is no use in pretending that the terrible incidents I have detailed are unprecedented or isolated. The abuse and attacks of this month are a reflection of the latent racism pervasive in Australia and around the world. Its latent racism that has been given licence by the reaction of governments to the virus. 

Our government has quarantined some Australian citizens and permanent residents most of whom are Chinese Australians in a mining camp and on Christmas Island without any kind of outcry. Despite the New South Wales government offering the Richmond RAAF base the federal government and Peter Dutton insisted on Christmas Island. This last fortnight I have tried to imagine whether the government would have swiftly engaged the apparatus of our refugee torture regime had the majority of the coronavirus victims been white. Try as I might its impossible to think that we would have seen this response if the virus had begun in the US or Britain. That the measure was put in place without an uproar without people flooding the streets in protest is a terrifying sign of just how systematic exercises in racism and xenophobia by the Australian government have become. It is only because they have spent years normalising arbitrary detention dehumanising refugees othering migrants and communities of colour and dog-whistling in parliament that this government can get away with locking up Chinese-Australian citizens on Christmas Island. This cannot be allowed to go on. 

I extend my most heartfelt solidarity to everyone in the community affected by the coronavirus and the horrifying racism weve seen in these last few weeks.

Business Insider

This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence Payments & Commerce subscribers earlier this morning.

The e-tailer announced that its core commerce segment brought in $20.3 billion in its fiscal Q3 2020 (ended December 31 2019) — outperforming its recent high of $15 billion from the comparable quarter the year prior.

Business Insider Intelligence

The segment which includes Alibaba’s retail business in China and abroad as well as related services like logistics and customer management accounted for 88% of the firm’s total revenue and grew 38% year-over-year (YoY) matching Alibaba’s overall annual revenue growth for the quarter.

This does represent a slight deceleration from the 40% YoY increase the firm posted last quarter and in the comparable period the year prior — but given the immense amount of revenue it brings in during its fiscal Q3 because of Singles’ Day its tentpole sales holiday 38% annual growth is still impressive.

The e-tailer’s performance on Singles’ Day and its continued innovation appear to be key drivers of its performance.

Alibaba expanded Singles’ Day’s reach in 2019 further establishing it as the biggest global e-commerce sales day and as a major event for the company. Alibaba brought in $38.4 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV) during the annual sales event which takes place on November 11.

Although other merchants and marketplaces also take advantage of the event Alibaba has been able to lead the way because it pioneered Singles’ Day leading its sales during the event to dwarf e-commerce revenue from Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And Alibaba is still growing the event: Its GMV rose 26% YoY and over 200000 brands including 22000 international brands took part in it. So Singles’ Day may be a driving force behind Alibaba’s success in the years to come as more merchants and consumers join in.

The company is also developing new features that are likely helping its performance and could set it up for future success. Taobao Live which sees merchants and key opinion leaders use a live broadcast to market to consumers saw its GMV and monthly active users increase 100% YoY in December 2019.

Meanwhile Alibaba also debuted a new delivery service from Sun Art Retail Group which Alibaba previously invested in to offer consumers speedy delivery for food and other products. By growing and launching new channels for sales Alibaba may be able to continue growing its retail business at a fast pace.

Despite Alibaba’s promising performance the coronavirus outbreak in China could weaken its sales in the short term. Issues like limited delivery capacity and closed restaurants that are a result of the outbreak are expected to impact parts of Alibaba’s business per Reuters.

These problems won’t necessarily damage the e-tailer’s long-term prospects but they could depress Alibaba’s retail performance in the next few quarters as it works to raise up its delivery capabilities and selection to its normal levels. And Alibaba isn’t alone in potentially facing fewer sales because of the outbreak: Merchants like Starbucks’ businesses in China are also at risk as are firms that rely on demand from Chinese tourists.

Back in December last year he was arrested for being a whistle blower spreading rumors about a mysterious pneumonia like virus. This morning we found out he was infact a fellow brother in Christ.

Can you imagine the joy he must have felt as he entered into eternity and heard the words Well done my good and faithful servant? 

So today please pray for his family especially his wife who is also infected and 8 months pregnant with their second child. May God heal them supernaturally n give them grace peace strength and comfort during this time.

Dr Li Wen Liang penned a deeply touching Chinese poem below of how he would miss his family his beloved Wuhan n quoted 2 Tim 4:7-8 I have fought the good fight I have finished the race I have kept the faith.

If the coronavirus proves to be serious as it does not appear to be at the present time many economies could be adversely affected. China is the source of many parts supplied to producers in other countries and China is the source of the finished products of many US firms such as Apple. If shipments cannot be made sales and production outside of China are affected. Without revenues employees cannot be paid. Unlike the financial crisis of 2008 this would be an unemployment crisis and bankruptcy of large manufacturing and marketing corporations.

This is the danger to which globalism makes us vulnerable. If US corporations produced in the US the products that they market in the US and the world an epidemic in China would affect only their Chinese sales not threaten the companies’ revenues.

The thoughtless people who constructed “globalism” overlooked that interdependence is dangerous and can have massive unintended consequences. With or without an epidemic supplies can be cut off for a number of reasons. For example strikes political instability natural catastrophes sanctions and other hostilities such as wars and so forth. Clearly these dangers to the system are not justified by the lower labor cost and consequent capital gains to shareholders and bonuses to corporate executives. Only the one percent benefits from globalism.

Globalism was constructed by people motivated by short-term greed. None of the promises of globalism have been delivered. Globalism is a massive mistake. Yet almost everywhere political leaders and economists are protective of globalism. So much for human intelligence.

At this point of time it is difficult to understand the hysteria over coronavirus and predictions of global pandemic. In China there are about 24000 infections and 500 deaths in a population of 1.3 billion people. This is an inconsequential illness. Compared to the ordinary seasonal flu that infects millions of people worldwide and kills 600000 the coronavirus so far amounts to nothing. Infections outside of China are miniscule and appear to be limited to Chinese people. It is difficult to know for certain because of the reluctance to identify people by race.

Yet China has huge areas in quarantine and travel to and from the country is restricted. Nothing like these precautions are taken against seasonal flu. So far this flu season in the US alone 19 million people have been sickened 180000 hospitalized and 10000 have died. The latest report is that 16 people in the US (possibly all Chinese) have come down with coronavirus and none have died. https:www.cnbc.com20200203the-flu-has-already-killed-10000-across-us-as-world-frets-over-coronavirus.html

Perhaps the coronavirus is just warming up and much worse is to come. If so world Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will take a hit. Quarantines prevent work. Finished products and parts cannot be made and shipped. Sales cannot take place without products to sell. Without revenues companies cannot pay employees and other expenses. Incomes decline across the world. Companies go bankrupt. You can take it from here.

If a deadly coronavirus pandemic or some other one does erupt and there is a world depression we should be very clear in our mind that globalism was the cause. Countries whose governments are so thoughtless or corrupt as to make their populations vulnerable to disruptive events abroad are medically economically socially and politically unstable.

The consequence of globalism is world instability.","100033702858436_219921019141325",

Given our ongoing dispute in the West Philippine Sea this move favors China and no longer comes as a surprise given how meek and subservient the Administration has been toward China in matters not only of sovereignty but even on matters of public health and safety as in the coronavirus epidemic.

The Administration cited the cancellation of the US visa of Senator dela Rosa and the supposed US interference in the countrys human rights record as basis for terminating the VFA. If the Administration thinks such an act will prevent their accountability for the impunity and the blatant disregard of human rights in the murderous drug war then they are mistaken. Sooner or later those behind the mass murder of our citizens mostly poor will be brought to justice.

In addition we believe such a notice is only valid with the concurrence of the Senate. The Senate therefore must assert its constitutional role in concurring with such a termination before it can take effect.","48622973199_10158143222543200","officialkikopangilinan"

All across China people are talking about Dr Li Wen Liang. He was the doctor who discovered the novel coronavirus and in the early morning of 7 Feb 2.58am he was promoted into glory and went home to be with our Father in heaven.

Back in December last year he was arrested for being a whistle blower spreading rumors about a mysterious pneumonia like virus. This morning we found out he was infact a fellow brother in Christ. Our hearts are deeply moved by his sacrificial choice to spread awareness about the virus despite the risks he faced especially to his reputation and to his own health.
He continued to care for patients up until he was infected himself. What a legacy to leave behind of what it means to be like Jesus to those hurting in a time of crisis.
He chose to be an example of Immanuel God with us to the people of Wuhan.
Can you imagine the joy he must have felt as he entered into eternity and heard the words Well done my good and faithful servant?

So today please pray for his family especially his wife who is also infected and 8 months pregnant with their second child. May God heal them supernaturally n give them grace peace strength and comfort during this time.

Dr Li Wen Liang penned a deeply touching Chinese poem below of how he would miss his family his beloved Wuhan n quoted 2 Tim 4:7-8 I have fought the good fight I have finished the race I have kept the faith. Finally there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous Judge will give to me on that Day and not to me only but also to all who have loved His appearing.

The Hero Who Told The Truth

Here is a captivating heart-touching Chinese poem Ive tried to translate into English. It was written in memory of Mr Li Wenliang a Christian doctor and whistleblower who died from the coronavirus himself after being punished for issuing the first warning about the deadly coronavirus outbreak.

I dont want to be a hero.
I still have my parents
And my children
And my pregnant wife whos about to give birth
And many of my patients in the ward.
Though my integrity cannot be exchanged for the goodness of others
Despite my loss and confusion
I should proceed anyway.
Who let me choose this country and this family?
How many grievances do I have?
When this battle is over
I will look up to the sky
With tears like rain.

I dont want to be a hero.
But as a doctor
I cannot just see this unknown virus
Hurting my peers
And so many innocent people.
Though they are dying
They are always looking at me in their eyes
With their hope of life.

“Who would have ever realised that I was going to die?
My soul is in heaven
Looking at the white bed
On which lies my own body
With the same familiar face.
Where are my parents?
And my dear wife
The lady I once had a hard time chasing?

There is a light in the sky!
At the end of that light is the heaven that people often talk about.
But Id rather not go there.
Id rather go back to my hometown in Wuhan.
I have my new house there
For which I still have to pay off the loan every month.
How can I give up?
How can I give up?
For my parents without their son
How sad must it be?
For my sweetheart without her husband
How can she face the vicissitudes in her future?

Gone like me
Being pushed into the fire in the hearth

A friend just sent me a photo of the groceries there and parang apocalypse na. As in wala ng laman ang shelves ng ibang groceries. 

UPDATE: Five britons tested positive for coronavirus and infection being traced to someone who traveled in SG. 

And I said I understand. Unlike the PH which is an agricultural country HK and SG heavily rely on imported products so that if borders are closed many will starve. 

In a way we are still a very very fortunate country. We are an agricultural nation and the world relies on poor PH to supply them with raw materials—yes even raw materials needed to make face masks. 

Maybe it’s time our government realizes we need to industrialize ASAP. Mura kinukuha sa atin ginagawa Lang naman sa ibang bansa pag balik sa atin mahal na. Not just for face mask raw materials but everything else. 

The PH is a rich rich country in all senses of the word if only hindi tayo inaabuso ng mga LGU natin na backdoor na ang negotiations sa mga minahan backdoor ang negotiations sa malalaking kumpanya at pabrika na hindi tama ang tax na pinapataw sa kanila kasi puro palusot at bribes ang nangyayari na ang nakikinabang ang fixer at hindi ang community. 

It’s time to really industrialize this country so we are not at the mercy of other people and countries. We have so much that we should never be at the mercy of anyone else. 

May this crisis mean opportunity for us—if we only know how to turn it into that.

May this country and this government move towards really truly equipping us with research and development facilities to help the PH industrialize.

despite yearly contest cancellation

It was disheartening but the La Filipina National High School (LFNHS) Marching Band members have to continue their regular practice during Saturdays even with the cancellation of the highlight of their service the annual Musikahan Festival of Tagum City.
“Everything was settled from the choreography down to the props. When it has been announced as cancelled last February 12 we cannot do anything about it since public health security is equally important against threat of novel coronavirus” LFNHS Marching Band Assistant Coordinator Dan Arvin Almero said in an interview with the Harbinger.
The LFNHS together with three other schools which comprises the Tagum Unified Marching Band according to Almero were supposed to join the Avenida Musika Symphonic Competition Musikahan Showdown Color Guards Competition and Baton Twirling events which were all cancelled.
“According to the City Tourism we will have a conference this coming Tuesday to settle the decision. If the events will only be postponed it will probably fall on April which is merely impossible because it will be in conflict with the schedule of other regional events” he emphasized.
Almero added that participants from the Unified Marching Band have been practicing the whole day of weekends prior to the cancellation.
“We may not have wasted our money yet for the costume and props but the students already spent their time effort and money for their fare and food during our practices” Almero added. 
In addition Majorette Christine Langub showed her dismay upon the event disruption.
“We already began rehearsing our  performance which is now in vain. It is also disappointing on the part of our new members who are supposed to be first-timers in the event” said Langub in an interview.
However Langub emphasized that the group proceeds with their constant training as part of their function.
“Being unable to compete this time does not mean we should stop with our passion that is why we still exert our effort” she noted.
The Department of Education earlier in February released the guideline on preventive measure of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV ARD) in basic education schools and offices after taking cue from Department of Health (DOH) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
Through DepEd Memorandum 15 s. 2020 all national and regional activities involving learners andor teachers for the month of February were postponed and DepEd discouraged division and district activities that involves gathering of learners.

Coronavirus in B.C. Interior
Wayne Moore - Feb 14 2020 
A fifth case of the novel coronavirus has been presumptively confirmed in British Columbia bringing the total number of cases in Canada to eight.
Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said Friday a woman in her 30s returned from Shanghai China in the past week through Vancouvers airport before travelling by car to her home in the Interior health region.
Henry said the woman wore a mask on the plane and contacted health officials when she had symptoms of an illness before being tested positive Tuesday for the virus that the World Health Organization has named COVID-19.
We are very grateful and thankful that the people who are coming back from Hubei province and all over China are taking the advice seriously to self monitor and to connect with us and make sure that they can be tested assessed and cared for safely she said.

The woman is in isolation at home as are her close contacts Henry said adding that in all cases a further test will be conducted at a national lab in Winnipeg to confirm the results obtained provincially.

Officials will be contacting passengers who sat three rows ahead and behind the woman on the aircraft that arrived from China but the risk to them is very very low she said.

The first person to be tested for the virus in the province is recovering well and has tested negative in the first of two tests that would indicate the virus no longer exists and isolation is no longer required she said.

Henry said 715 tests have been done on about 500 people returning from China based on a low threshold for testing of the virus that originated in Hubei province.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said British Columbia has done more testing than any other jurisdiction.

A woman in her 30s is the fifth person in B.C. registering a presumptive positive for the COVID-19 virus.

According to provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry the patient is somewhere in the Interior and shes being monitored by Interior Health.

She would not say exactly where the woman is but indicated she is at home and doing well.

Henry says confirmation is still required from the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg.

The woman reportedly flew to Vancouver from Shanghai. This is the fifth case of the deadly coronavirus detected in B.C. The other four are said to be recovering at home.

Dr. Henry did not indicate where the the fifth patient resides but the Interior Health region covers a large area from 100 Mile House to Cranbrook.

Worldwide more than 64000 cases of the virus have been reported. In China 1380 people have died from the virus.

Julie Ball a former resident of Wuhan helps us connect the dots. No there is no smoking gun. Just food for thought.... ??

Julie Ball: || Theres a lot more to this US battle with Huawei than cell phones. It has to do with warfare Charles Lieber...and also Wuhan. Wuhan? Yes Wuhan. But not in the way some Youtubers may think...

OK people might wonder why I say the US military industrial complex and the neocons are freaking out about 5G and cell phones. Its more than just cell phones. The technology that China is working on will in the view of the US DoD change the nature of warfare forever. Its a big flipping deal.

According to a White House Defense industry report Another concern are China’s advances in “foundational dual-use industries such as semiconductors chip materials robotics aviation and satellites” the report says. As technical innovation moves abroad “changing rules around intellectual property development will impede U.S. access to the latest manufacturing technologies.” At risk is America’s loss of leadership in industries of the future such as artificial intelligence quantum computing and robotics the report notes. “Over the remainder of this century these emerging industries will help redefine the BATTLEFIELD.” 

Charles Lieber chair of Harvards department of chemistry and member of the Chinas Thousand Talents Program. who was doing research with the Wuhan University of Technology didnt get unjustly arrested for nothing. They say he was covering up ties to China. How ridiculous! His name was probably listed on the Thousand Talents website. FBI doesnt have the internet or what?

Julie Ball a former resident of Wuhan helps us connect the dots. No there is no smoking gun. Just food for thought.... ??

Julie Ball: || Theres a lot more to this US battle with Huawei than cell phones. It has to do with warfare Charles Lieber...and also Wuhan. Wuhan? Yes Wuhan. But not in the way some Youtubers may think...

OK people might wonder why I say the US military industrial complex and the neocons are freaking out about 5G and cell phones. Its more than just cell phones. The technology that China is working on will in the view of the US DoD change the nature of warfare forever. Its a big flipping deal.

According to a White House Defense industry report Another concern are China’s advances in “foundational dual-use industries such as semiconductors chip materials robotics aviation and satellites” the report says. As technical innovation moves abroad “changing rules around intellectual property development will impede U.S. access to the latest manufacturing technologies.” At risk is America’s loss of leadership in industries of the future such as artificial intelligence quantum computing and robotics the report notes. “Over the remainder of this century these emerging industries will help redefine the BATTLEFIELD.” 

Charles Lieber chair of Harvards department of chemistry and member of the Chinas Thousand Talents Program. who was doing research with the Wuhan University of Technology didnt get unjustly arrested for nothing. They say he was covering up ties to China. How ridiculous! His name was probably listed on the Thousand Talents website. FBI doesnt have the internet or what?

Since this morning joint teams from the Town Council and NEA were at Bukit Batok Street 31 where the resident’s apartment block is to conduct deep and extensive cleaning and ensure thorough sanitizing of the premises and common public areas. I joined them and saw how NEA and town council teams have also ramped up across our Bukit Gombak estate the cleaning frequency for places of high human traffic especially “hi-touch” spots like lift buttons playgrounds and railings. This heightened scrutiny of hygiene is part of our overall efforts against the 2019-nCoV. 

Many workers including those in the healthcare and public sector are working tirelessly to protect us and care for those who are affected by the virus. It is at such a time like this when we need to pull together even more. Stay vigilant practise a high standard of personal hygiene and wash our hands regularly. Let’s be socially responsible and stay home if unwell. 

As we work together to fight this virus let us be mindful of how we need each other to move as one - in mind hearts and efforts - to overcome the challenges posed by this threat. Let us continue to support one another - empathise with those affected and extend care to them.

A plane full of US citizens left Wuhan on Tuesday night the first evacuation flight out of the centre of China’s coronavirus outbreak and landed in Anchorage Alaska. But thousands of foreigners from other countries remain trapped in the stricken city.

They include football coaches airline pilots teachers and students who had found a home in the central Chinese city as its economy boomed.

Divyank Parekh a 20-year-old student said he was one of about 50 Indian students who remained in the dormitories at Wuhan University School of Medicine. 

“We’re very worried because we see people getting ill around us” said Mr Parekh. “We’ve called the Indian consulate hotline many times but they told us to wait. We don’t know how much longer it will take for them to help us.”

According to official statistics Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei is home to tens of thousands of long-term foreign workers and students. Many have been unable to leave after the local government closed the airport public transport and road links last week in an attempt to contain the virus. Officials have given no indication of when the measures will be lifted.

There are now 5974 cases in China 1239 of whom are severely ill according to state media on Wednesday. China also reported 26 new deaths overnight 25 of whom were in Hubei bringing the death toll to 132.

So far the US Japan France and South Korea are the only countries to have confirmed timings for flights to evacuate citizens by air. The EU confirmed an evacuation for “over 100” citizens. France said its citizens would be held in quarantine after being repatriated. Japanese citizens will be medically examined before boarding the evacuation flight and will be asked to monitor their health for two weeks after their return.

The British government said on Wednesday it was “working hard” to evacuate citizens from Wuhan who will be “safely isolated for 14 days with all necessary medical attention”.

Expatriates have been calling their embassies and consulates for information but have been frustrated by the response. “We have not had any specific information on evacuation. It has been a very difficult time” said Giuseppe an Italian national who works at a ceramics company in Wuhan.

Tom Williams a British teacher in Wuhan whose Canadian wife is 35 weeks’ pregnant appealed to the government for help in an online post. “I just want to share our story so I can try and get my wife son and unborn child safely out of the city” he wrote. 

At a meeting in Beijing on Monday China’s foreign ministry said it was taking effective measures to combat the virus and advised foreign governments against evacuating their citizens according to people who were present.

“They said they don’t encourage or recommend evacuation. At the same time they also said if foreign governments decide to evacuate their citizens they would co-operate” said one diplomat.

Dani Carmona a Spanish coach at a Wuhan football team said he had stayed indoors for six days with his girlfriend. “We spend the day watching movies reading . . . waiting for the permission from the Chinese government and the Spanish embassy to leave” he said.

The US chartered a plane to remove consulate officials selling tickets to some non-government staff including workers at a glass factory owned by industrial company Corning at a cost of $1000 per head. 

“These travellers will be carefully screened and monitored to protect their health as well as the health and safety of their fellow Americans here at home” the US state department said.

The virus is said to have affected more than 20 thousand people and killing more than 600 worldwide. Professor Wurie was speaking on the preparedness of the Sierra Leone government to tackle the virus at the weekly Ministry of Information and Communications press conference held at Youyi Building in Freetown.

Prof. Wurie refused to disclose the quarantine location and ordered that every office school and public places in the country should return to hand washing adding that his ministry has instituted mobile thermo-scans at the Freetown International Airport and are about to start using it in the Kambia border.

“We want the public to know that Sierra Leone has decided to quarantine people that are coming from the epicenter for 14 days because the virus can be asymptomatic for a very long time” said.

He added that the Emergency Operation Center (EOC) of Sierra Leone has been activated and linked with other institutions including the Military ONS NGOs and others related to health emergencies.

Airline staffs airport attendants Customs Immigration and Security officers according to Professor Wurie are now on intensive training to learn how to protect themselves and how to screen people coming into the country but mostly people coming from the epicenter.

He explained further that they have prepared a treatment center at the isolation unit at the 34 Military Hospital the Government Lungi Hospital and another at the China-Sierra Leone Friendship Hospital in Jui.

“We are in the position to do front line surveillance by having thermo-scan and we are in the position to test for the virus in the country and we have also put treatment centers at the ready” he said.

Prof. Wurie disclosed that on Friday 21st January 2020 25 Chinese nationals arrived at the GuineaSierra Leone border and that 7 out of the 25 wished to come into Sierra Leone but that after they were educated that they will go into the Gbalamunya holding center for 14 days quarantine they preferred to return to Guinea.

“On Tuesday the 3rd February 2020 29 passengers arrived in Sierra Leone from China and they are currently quarantined. I cannot tell you where but it’s a military protected site” he said.

He added that the measures being put in place are in conformity with guidelines of international health regulators to prevent and avoid any travel related introduction of the virus into the country.

In a related development the acting Chief Medical Officer in the Ministry of Health and Sanitation Dr. Donald Bash-Taqi has told AYV that the number quarantined arrivals has increased to 34 following the arrival of the 29 passengers from the epicenter of the Coronavirus in China.","100003739538109_VK_1588254907994021","patrickamadu.kai"

Westlessness to be discussed against backdrop of Middle East conflicts coronavirus woes and Kashmir crackdown.

Ruairi Casey 

Berlin Germany - The wars in Libya and Yemen brewing tensions elsewhere in the Middle East and Indias lockdown of Kashmir are among the most pressing geopolitical concerns as world leaders and diplomats prepare to rub shoulders at the Munich Security Conference often regarded as the Davos of security and foreign policy issues.

Thirty-five heads of state are among more than 500 politicians officials and spies scheduled to attend the three-day summit which begins on Friday and ends Sunday.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo French President Emmanuel Macron NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the foreign ministers of Russia Iran and India are all expected.

This years theme of westlessness organisers say points to continued unease about the identity and purpose of the West.

It reflects a growing schism in transatlantic relations and the post-war order as Donald Trumps presidency pushes the United States further from Europe.

Common security in Europe is also a growing issue the continent itself is fractured following Brexit and amid the growth of nationalist and illiberal movements.

Verging on the existential conference organisers have urged attendees to consider if the world and the West itself is becoming less Western and how global security will be shaped if Western powers fade in relevance and influence.

For the past decades the answer to the question what it was that kept the West together was straightforward: a commitment to liberal democracy and human rights to a market-based economy and to international cooperation in international institutions read this years Munich Security Report which was published before the conference.

Today the meaning of the West is increasingly contested again.

Platform for searing speeches

The Munich Security Conference was established in 1963 by Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist-Schmenzin a former German army officer who participated in a failed attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler with the aim of gathering leaders and diplomatic experts to discuss the state of NATO and relations between powers on either side of the Atlantic.

Over the decades the annual meeting has grown to include global security concerns with Munichs grand Bayerisch Hof hotel becoming a stage for searing political speeches.

In 2007 in Munich Russian President Vladimir Putin excoriated the US for overstepping its borders in all spheres.

Last year German Chancellor Angela Merkel clashed with US Vice President Mike Pence over the Iran nuclear deal rejecting US pressure for Europe to pull out of the agreement and arguing that it provided the best path to maintaining influence over the Islamic Republic.

Merkel will not attend this year with Foreign Minister Heiko Mass instead representing Germany which may seek to build on its role as a facilitator in Libyas shaky peace process. 

The conference is usually a backdrop for heated clashes over narratives rather than provide a forum to actually solve security issues.
Andreas Krieg assistant professor at Kings College London

In January a major summit in Berlin brought all foreign backers to the conflict together for the first time.

I would expect discussion around Libya maybe with the EU and the EU representative taking a role there Sarah Bressan a research associate at the Global Public Policy Institute told Al Jazeera.

Germany will try to continue these efforts now that it has a seat at the table after the Berlin conference to get parties to actually respect the arms the UN arms embargo which has already been breached she added.

Iran is also likely to be a focal point once again following the US assassination of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad in January which sparked international outrage and risked a major military confrontation.

The US-Iran crisis will be very much an agenda-setter as Munich provides a platform for both the Iranians and anti-Iran hawks from the US and Israel to make their voices heard Andreas Krieg assistant professor at Kings College London told Al Jazeera.

For the most part though the conference is usually a backdrop for heated clashes over narratives rather than provide a forum to actually solve security issues.

So nobody expects that the US and Iran will actually use the conference to open backchannels.

Despite several face-to-face meetings between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last year aimed at cooling tensions Pyongyang has continued to develop its ballistic and nuclear weapon programmes which will be a top priority for South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha who travels to Munich this weekend.

North Korea conducted several long-range missile tests in December as Kim threatened the US with a Christm

Demuja started his journey into music production and DJing long ago inside the vibrant depths of B-Boy culture. Coming from Salzburg (home of Mozart) Demuja’s history in Breakdance and playing as a Drummer from an early age informed every twist and break in the Austrian Beat-Makers arsenal. Also influenced by visionaries such as Kerri Chandler MCDE and Glenn Underground the Austrian house wizard soon carved a solid name for himself inside the world of Raw House with an unmistakable sonic range flirting between smooth and feel good melodic vibes to heavy kick drum workouts and laid back space funk.. And always represented with a touch of Soul! On stage he will be joined by DOS and Jon Gravy the Dzc. Birthday Floor will be hosted by Dzc. dRob and Steve Hoder courtesy of Step Back Trax.

Franjazzco (formerly known as Franz „Jazzin“ Otto) has definitely been one of the most passionate and enthusiastic players in Vienna’s underground dance music scene within the last decade. While doing his thing on the ones and twos since way back in 1995 the past has also seen him as event promoter radio host editor and recently especially as a producer. Whilst Franjazzco covers a wide range of musical genres as a DJ ranging from Jazz Funk and Hip Hop to House Techno and various styles of Bass music he’s mostly dedicating his productions to Chicago’s sound of Juke and Footwork. Jay Smoo started DJing in 2008 having the sweet resident spot at the legendary NonStop cinema in Graz for 2 years. Shortly after that he moved to Vienna and became part of the eminent Danceteria Crew that brought names such as Scuba Bicep Midland and many others to the Austrian Capital. As a promoter Jay Smoo continued his journey through GLOW and eventually Service- one of the best eclectic electronic music evenings in the city. The 2 Dons are hosting an all-night longer at everyone’s favourite Solaris- Linz rumour has it that it will be an epic B2B session…don’t miss!

First the new virus is more infectious than Sars. Therefore it is harder to stop it from spreading. Second the new virus is much less dangerous than Sars. About 10 per cent of those who caught Sars died. With the new virus outside of Hubei province the mortality rate is so far only 0.2 per cent. In comparison seasonal influenza has a death rate of 0.1 per cent. So in terms of mortality the new virus is much closer to influenza than Sars.

The paper was published in nature by said scientists. There just happened to be a US consolate and agents at the epicenter. 

Here we examine the disease potential of a SARS-like virus SHC014-CoV which is currently circulating in Chinese horseshoe bat populations1. Using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system2 we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone. The results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV.

China and the U.S.A. and all nations should work together to fight the Coronavirus outbreak as we worked closely with African nations hit hard by Ebola. Its a no brainer! Viruses do NOT discriminate on the basis of race age sex religion or national origin. The ASU college co-ed of Chinese descent complaining of racism because others dont want to be near her due to fear of Coronavirus is luckier than the late Ryan White whose Florida neighbors burned down the house Ryan and his mom and dad lived in. Young Ryan White was HIV due to his hemophilia and receiving HIV-infected blood products. Fear of disease is a normal natural human reaction but there is no excuse for ignorant over-reaction. During the early days of HIVAIDS in the USA folks were terrified to shake hands drink from the same communion cup at church ride the bus eat meals together or do anything at all with people who might be infected with Human Immune Virus. We now know that HIV is spread sexually or through receiving infected blood or organs or from mother to baby. Sharing infected needles and syringes is the single highest-risk behavior for contracting HIV or hepatitis followed by anal sex. Each disease has its own ways of transmission.

Due to his energetic and clear anti-American pro-CCP activities AND now by trying to become POTUS Bloomberg is creating a horrific embarrassment to the US and all Americans.

By his andor his companies’ actions and apparent motives and efforts Mike Bloomberg has already shown himself to be a sexual predator racist totalitarian dictator greedy self-centered ultra-elitist traitor to the US and Americans and – via his loyalties to and support of China’s Communist Party’s goals activities lies and threats – a truly horrific corrosive danger to the rights freedoms current and future economic living and cultural conditions and outlooks for Americans Japanese South Koreans Brits Australians Indians Europeans and the citizens of all countries located anywhere near CCP China.  

Wont the US Justice Dept. FBI as well as FCC and CIA be deemed grossly negligent and incompetent if the person that may be the greatest CCP asset of all time (already) also gets elected (V)POTUS or secures a key cabinet seat?

Isn’t it or won’t it be a FEDERAL criminal offense (and a criminal offense in most or all states?) that Mike Bloomberg will not declare his CCP-based income even after hes on state ballots as a POTUS candidate? 

Isnt it a criminal offense for Americans to take $$ to promote the CCP or Russia or North Korea via their US or worldwide news media?

With Mike Bloombergs very close and supportive relationship with Xi and the CCP and all the money CCP agencies or companies pay why are Federal security judicial or election agencies and state Attorneys General STILL NOT PROHIBITING Bloomberg from running for POTUS?   

Why is Bloomberg being allowed on any state ballots??

Even the minimal current view available of Bloomberg’s business relationships with revenues from and support for China Communist Party leaders entities and their goals and activities show his loyalties to the CCP and against the US and Americans.

Trade Deal With China Is a Blockbuster
What the Democrats fear most is happening: President Trump and his negotiating team are reaching wide-ranging agreements with China that will be a huge boon to the United States.

In an Oval Office press conference yesterday President Trump and China’s Vice Premier announced a Phase 1 set of agreements that will be documented over the next several weeks. The video of the press conference is embedded below Trump’s performance was masterful. His many years of experience as a negotiator shine through.

The Phase 1 agreement covers several important topics including agricultural sales. China has agreed to ramp up its purchases of agricultural products to $40-$50 billion–three times the previous peak–over the next two years. Trump joked that farmers will need to buy more land and work overtime. That means I think that Democrats can say goodbye to hopes that tariffs would be the issue that could win votes in rural America.

The agreement also opens up China’s financial services markets to American companies covers currency manipulation and addresses some aspects of intellectual property and technology transfer agreements. Phase 2 negotiations will begin immediately.

In view of the Phase 1 agreement new tariffs scheduled to go into effect on October 15 have been canceled. Further tariff increases are scheduled for December 15 but Trump and Steven Mnuchin who participated in the press conference emphasized that there is plenty of time to reach a Phase 2 agreement that would nullify those increases. Phase 2 could be the final agreement or if there are still open issues there could be a Phase 3.

Many are saying that the Chinese willingness to enter into this wide-ranging agreement shows that they understand impeachment is a joke and expect that President Trump will be re-elected. In fact Trump himself said exactly that in response to a question: “They expect that I’m going to win. Otherwise they wouldn’t sign the deal. It’s very simple.” If Trump can get our relationship with China straightened out well in advance of the election with economic benefits becoming visible the main obstacle to his re-election will in my opinion be removed.

HAVE I MISSED THIS? ARE ANY FOODS BEING ALLOWED INTO OUR COUNTRY  FROM CHINA? SINCE PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST MADE A GREAT DEAL WITH CHINA DID THE DEMOCRAT TERRORISTS IN CONGRESS SEND KERRY OR WORSE OVER TO CHINA TO THROW A KINK IN THE CHAIN? THEY ARE CAPABLE OF ANYTHING!

Robert O’Brien the White House national security adviser said on Tuesday that the outbreak could reduce Chinese purchases of American agricultural products this year.

“We expected the phase one deal will allow China to import more food and open those markets to American farmers but certainly as we watch this coronavirus outbreak unfold in China it could have an impact on how big – at least in this current year – the purchases are” O’Brien said at an event at the Atlantic Council a Washington think tank.

The economic standstill and the lockdown of cities in China as part of its measures to control the deadly virus has created uncertainty over whether diplomatic and political matters will remain on schedule.

Meanwhile the Novel Coronavirus can stay alive for hundreds of hours in cold temperatures with low humidity (that includes air conditioning) and for two hours in warm temperatures with high humidity.

The World Health Organization (WHO) warns of ongoing Coronavirus-themed phishing attacks that impersonate the organization with the end goal of stealing information and delivering malware.

Criminals are disguising themselves as WHO to steal money or sensitive information the United Nations agency says in the Coronavirus scam alert.

WHO is aware of suspicious email messages attempting to take advantage of the 2019 novel coronavirus emergency.

The phishing messages are camouflaged to appear as being sent by WHO officials and ask the targets to share sensitive info like usernames and passwords redirect them to a phishing landing page via malicious links embedded in the emails or ask them to open malicious attachments containing malware payloads.

If you are contacted by a person or organization that appears to be from WHO verify their authenticity before responding says the WHO.

You can do that by following the steps detailed below:

1. Verify the sender by checking their email address — WHO sender addresses use the personwho.int pattern.

2. Check the link before you click — make sure the links start with https:www.who.int or enter the address manually in the browser.

3. Be careful when providing personal information — never provide your credentials to third parties not even the WHO.
4. Do not rush or feel under pressure — dont fall for tricks designed to pressure you into clicking links or opening attachments.

5. If you gave sensitive information don’t panic — reset your credentials on sites youve used them.

6. If you see a scam report it at https:www.who.intaboutreport_scamen.

 The crux of the West is the election system Once a politician is elected he will use his power to develop his own interests. China took advantage of this feature and acquired all political leaders of the world. China is ruling the world. Politicians of various countries killed the people and destroyed the motherlands economy because they surrendered to China.
 If there isn’t China on the world so the electoral system is not a big disadvantage the exchange of interests between capitalist countries is also not so dangerous.
 Everything of China is bullying. China is not capable its only bullying. So China is the easiest woman to be defeated. It only fears force!

 Counter-revolutionaries never talk about brain control
 China has ruled U.S. by controlling U.S. brain controller brain controllers control political figures in the US. Democratic Party has completely surrendered to china it will easily betray if its in power.
 So China chosed Andrewa Chinese as the next U.S. president. So third-rates are in politics Democrats deceive people with tolerant and multiple. Germany and France cooperated with them to turn world into china slave.

 One person to one country
 American politicians after leaving office have no protection and are arbitrarily maimed by China.
 After being abused the politicians who came to powerall obeyed China so the Democratic Party surrendered to China.
 The president has only a few staff members and his clothes are taken from his wardrobe. There are tens of millions of researchers in China’s core research institutions.
 Trump cant resist the sighting and murder of a country. China easily launches impeachment Trump begged for mercy: trade Kurdish Huawei......
 Because of the system the US is bound to perish.

 Who made the coronavirus outbreak?
 No need to consider : this is an extremely useful stalling tactics of China China wants to transfer the evil to another and kill foreign people……
 Only need to consider: Did the better people die from the plague? If so then China made the plague.

 Our only weapon is western people
 The world is a political capitulation to China.Chinas economy is already invincibleand will soon do so militarily.China destroys culture by killing elites all over the world.Russia on which we are focused cannot do such a thing.

 The biggest characteristic of capitalism
 Even after Brexit Britain ’s moves are just some small businesses. The US-China trade agreement is a largest business but also a small business. So America and Europe are bound to perish.
 Trades of their ancestors were the biggest deals but their current trades are the smallest things.
 This is actually a question of capitalist heritage.

 Because the Democrats have surrendered to China
 So the essence of the impeachment case is that Trump not only did not break the law but also worked hard to save the people and country.

 A contradiction
 China says the world tide?in fact its aggression broke the pattern.
 The weak have no chance of survival!We must choose some strong friends to defeat the biggest devil china.
 Our key: for the reactionary ruleChina only uses foolsChina will conquer America.

 Another contradiction
 Western people are different from the bourgeoisie. None of western people is afraid of death but bourgeoise power figures are afraid of death in the face of Chinese aggression.
 This is because of thinking spiritual level consciousness levels of both classes are different.
 This is the most important contradiction in this world and this is a task of the Cultural Revolution.

 The essence of capitalism
 The spirit of capitalism is mercifulness but now the bourgeoisie has not inherited mercifulness. The ruling class has not big benevolence and real benevolence they fear war.

-  Coronavirus is not the name of this particular virus.  Coronavirus is the name of the category of virus to which this virus belongs.  Its actual name is 2019-nCoV.

-  This virus is no more deadly than the average flu perhaps even less so.  More than 60000 people have been infected in a population of more than 1.3 billion with less than 1600 fatalities.  Thats not a cause for panic or alarm.  

-  The majority of those who have died from this particular virus are the very old and those who have preexisting health conditions especially preexisting lung disease and compromised immune systems.

-  The survival rate of those who are otherwise healthy is nearly 100%.

-  The highly contagious nature of this virus is due to the fact that its new to humans.  We dont have the antibodies to fight it.  As the disease makes its rounds humans will eventually develop some measure of defense to it.  

-  To put this viral outbreak into context every year in the US alone between 14000 and 61000 people die of the flu or complications caused by the flu.  Yet these grim statistics rarely make headlines.  

-  The symptoms of coronavirus are nearly identical to the flu runny nose fever dry cough chills aches and pains diarrhea and vomiting.  In effect this virus is nothing more than a new strain of the flu.  

-  Despite the medias best efforts to create such an image there are no mountains of bodies being incinerated by ominous government workers in yellow Hazmat suits.  Those who are infected are not bleeding from their orifices while their flesh slowly liquefies like in some third rate Hollywood film.  

-  More than 99% of all cases of infection are in China.  If you do not live in China or have contact with anyone who has been to China recently your chances of contracting this virus are less than winning the Power Ball Lottery.  Your chances of contracting the virus and dying from it are less than winning the Power Ball Lottery twice in a row.

-  The panic and hysteria surrounding this viral outbreak was created by the media for the sake of ratings internet traffic and ad revenue.  

-  Ever since this non-issue has dominated the headlines all reports of the civil unrest in Hong Kong have stopped.  Weird.","10159044100031336_496710767946523",

 A spokesperson for Tencent said this site aggregates and reports health information from China’ s National Health Commission and other health authorties and said the screenshots that differ from official statistics are doctored according to the Hong Kong English news site Dimsum Daily.

Theres so much I want to share with you this week. A group of researchers say smartphone addiction causes physical changes to your brain similar to drug use. Plus malware that preys on coronavirus fears is spreading as fast as the illness. And jetpacks aren’t just science fiction anymore as one company just passed a major milestone in a test of their high-tech wingsuit.

Western leaders have completely surrendered to China They helped China kill the people and betray the country. The people are getting poorer and their bodies and minds are seriously damaged by China Brain control! Only bad people support their rule So they dont allow good people to survive. Good people who dont know the reason must be in their trap become extreme right.
So Merkel is not fighting violence but helping China to kill Western people.

Name studying
This article only discusses events about names. In fact thats about a tool after the Chinese ruled the world and good people resisted China. Although the facts and logic temporarily support such conclusions but we are only talking about names.
Presidents all over the world are chosen based on me now I finally noticed my unusualness! 
When I arrived in India Modis name surprised me if its called Confucius or Zhuangzi should be good. But “Modi” is must chinese must with Chinese support. Xi Jinping just admired the ancient Chinese scholar Modi.
Cai yingwen the President of Taiwan is me and I have been banned from learning English by China all my life. Han guoyu is the chinese yu family that destroyed South Korea and killed all Westerners. Xi Jinping is Ma pingping my classmate with the same habits as me. So nominally I used to be Xi Jinping ’s group. I were called dragon (ron) Macron is the bad guy whos for attacking me. Merkel and Joko are You ke of yu family…...Names reflected whether the president is a good person.
Bad presidents are supported by China they surrendered to China killed the people betrayed the country. They are dog legs of china for robbery and ruling world.
British Prime Minister looks like xi jinping a cannibalism with brain control technology Iike Ben Johnson taking some stimulant. Now I be called Carl Lewis. Johnson used the power of Brexit to win parliamentary elections and then show his true face disrespectful of Trump at NATO Summit Counter-revolutionary acts this is a Chinese scheme!

Our only weapon is western people
The world is a political capitulation to China.Chinas economy is already invincibleand will soon do so militarily.China destroys culture by killing elites all over the world.Russia on which we are focused cannot do such a thing.

Counter-revolutionaries never talk about brain control
China has ruled U.S. by controlling U.S. brain controller brain controllers control political figures in the US. Democratic Party has completely surrendered to china it will easily betray if its in power.
So China chosed Andrewa Chinese as the next U.S. president. So third-rates are in politics Democrats deceive people with tolerant and multiple. Germany and France cooperated with them to turn world into china slave.

One person to one country
American politicians after leaving office have no protection and are arbitrarily maimed by China.
After being abused the politicians who came to powerall obeyed China so the Democratic Party surrendered to China.
The president has only a few staff members and his clothes are taken from his wardrobe. There are tens of millions of researchers in China’s core research institutions.
Trump cant resist the sighting and murder of a country. China easily launches impeachment Trump begged for mercy: trade Kurdish Huawei......
Because of the system the US is bound to perish.

Because the Democrats have surrendered to China
So the essence of the impeachment case is that Trump not only did not break the law but also worked hard to save the people and country.

Who made the coronavirus outbreak?
No need to consider : this is an extremely useful stalling tactics of China China wants to transfer the evil to another and kill foreign people……
Only need to consider: Did the better people die from the plague? If so then China made the plague.

The biggest characteristic of capitalism
Even after Brexit Britain ’s moves are just some small businesses. The US-China trade agreement is a largest business but also a small business. So America and Europe are bound to perish.
Trades of their ancestors were the biggest deals but their current trades are the smallest things.
This is actually a question of capitalist heritage.

Why military elimination of China is the only way
The crux of the West is the election system Once a politician is elected he will use his power to develop his own interests. China took advantage of this feature and acquired all political leaders of the world. China is ruling the world. Politicians of various countries killed the people and destroyed the motherlands economy because they surrendered to China.
If there isn’t China on the world so the electoral system is not a big disadvantage the exchange of interests between capitalist countries is also not so dangerous.
Everything of China is bullying. China is not capable its only bullyi

They have never had access to vaccines or proper hygiene but they are still infectious . Yet quarantine them and all hell breaks loose .. Read a story of a person that  that had an infectious form of TB a rather nasty one that is resistance to treatment in California . they had him quarantined and he left .  The media squished that because they did not want to upset people . Media has a way of picking and choosing what they want to hype .. If you read even in the Soviet Union two were quarantined and they left quarantine.  this out break started last September. So how many world wide were already exposed. Regular testing will not show this strain either so going to a Er just to find out if you have it is a waste of time only cdc test for this strain ... it is not a normal incubation of 14days  it can be up to 24 days   Most people don’t even realize  that they may have it .. also there are multiple strains of coronavirus  that have been  about for years  I Even had a strain a few years ago .. rsv is not just for children or babies adult catch it to .

How do you get paid ... people have to work .. eat pay bill  world does not stop if your sick ... How many people still go to work with the flu .  Enterovirus . Rhinovirus  and a few other virus  Against doctor orders .. jobs do not allow people off so this stuff spreads ... 
People don’t do what they should .. and the laws anymore don’t force them to .. my recommendations is strict  hand washing soap water . Purell does nothing fyi .

Western leaders have completely surrendered to China They helped China kill the people and betray the country. The people are getting poorer and their bodies and minds are seriously damaged by China Brain control! Only bad people support their rule So they dont allow good people to survive. Good people who dont know the reason must be in their trap become extreme right.
So Merkel is not fighting violence but helping China to kill Western people.

The biggest characteristic of capitalism
Even after Brexit Britain ’s moves are just some small businesses. The US-China trade agreement is a largest business but also a small business. So America and Europe are bound to perish.
Trades of their ancestors were the biggest deals but their current trades are the smallest things.
This is actually a question of capitalist heritage.

Name studying
This article only discusses events about names. In fact thats about a tool after the Chinese ruled the world and good people resisted China. Although the facts and logic temporarily support such conclusions but we are only talking about names.
Presidents all over the world are chosen based on me now I finally noticed my unusualness! 
When I arrived in India Modis name surprised me if its called Confucius or Zhuangzi should be good. But “Modi” is must chinese must with Chinese support. Xi Jinping just admired the ancient Chinese scholar Modi.
Cai yingwen the President of Taiwan is me and I have been banned from learning English by China all my life. Han guoyu is the chinese yu family that destroyed South Korea and killed all Westerners. Xi Jinping is Ma pingping my classmate with the same habits as me. So nominally I used to be Xi Jinping ’s group. I were called dragon (ron) Macron is the bad guy whos for attacking me. Merkel and Joko are You ke of yu family…...Names reflected whether the president is a good person.
Bad presidents are supported by China they surrendered to China killed the people betrayed the country. They are dog legs of china for robbery and ruling world.
British Prime Minister looks like xi jinping a cannibalism with brain control technology Iike Ben Johnson taking some stimulant. Now I be called Carl Lewis. Johnson used the power of Brexit to win parliamentary elections and then show his true face disrespectful of Trump at NATO Summit Counter-revolutionary acts this is a Chinese scheme!

Our only weapon is western people
The world is a political capitulation to China.Chinas economy is already invincibleand will soon do so militarily.China destroys culture by killing elites all over the world.Russia on which we are focused cannot do such a thing.

Counter-revolutionaries never talk about brain control
China has ruled U.S. by controlling U.S. brain controller brain controllers control political figures in the US. Democratic Party has completely surrendered to china it will easily betray if its in power.
So China chosed Andrewa Chinese as the next U.S. president. So third-rates are in politics Democrats deceive people with tolerant and multiple. Germany and France cooperated with them to turn world into china slave.

One person to one country
American politicians after leaving office have no protection and are arbitrarily maimed by China.
After being abused the politicians who came to powerall obeyed China so the Democratic Party surrendered to China.
The president has only a few staff members and his clothes are taken from his wardrobe. There are tens of millions of researchers in China’s core research institutions.
Trump cant resist the sighting and murder of a country. China easily launches impeachment Trump begged for mercy: trade Kurdish Huawei......
Because of the system the US is bound to perish.

Because the Democrats have surrendered to China
So the essence of the impeachment case is that Trump not only did not break the law but also worked hard to save the people and country.

Who made the coronavirus outbreak?
No need to consider : this is an extremely useful stalling tactics of China China wants to transfer the evil to another and kill foreign people……
Only need to consider: Did the better people die from the plague? If so then China made the plague.

Why military elimination of China is the only way
The crux of the West is the election system Once a politician is elected he will use his power to develop his own interests. China took advantage of this feature and acquired all political leaders of the world. China is ruling the world. Politicians of various countries killed the people and destroyed the motherlands economy because they surrendered to China.
If there isn’t China on the world so the electoral system is not a big disadvantage the exchange of interests between capitalist countries is also not so dangerous.
Everything of China is bullying. China is not capable its only bullyi

CheckPoints security researchers found that hackers started taking advantage of Coronavirus psychosis to spread their malware through spam email campaigns that emulate sending information regarding the spread of the virus. Viruses spread through another virus. Except that the former are electronic malware and the latter Coronavirus biological. Obviously we are not talking about some strange biotechnological hybridization but much more simply the exploitation of Coronavirus psychosis as a stratagem to spread computer viruses as evidenced by the researchers of the security company CheckPoint in their latest report many hackers are trying to capitalize on peoples fears of spreading malware via email spam campaigns. The latter in fact simulate the sending of official documentation on the spread of the virus by world organizations (such as WHO for example the World Health Organization) or local (such as the US CDC the Center for Disease Control and Prevention)  which actually contains various types of malware attached or links that lead to phishing sites. As usual therefore the advice is to always be very careful towards any unexpected email that requires you to download or open attachments click on links or insert personal data although apparently it appears to come from reliable sites. Hackers and scammers in fact rely on the fear that has spread around the Coronavirus to surprise users with low guard tricking them into handing over their data or allowing access to various types of malware on their computers. an email however is not difficult. First of all just start from the assumption that a real organization would hardly ask you for things like clicking on a link to log in download attachments or run programs. In general then it would be enough to pay attention to the grammatical correctness of the text often automatically generated by a translator and therefore coarse. Finally open the official website of the organization you think has contacted you separately on the browser and then compare the official URL with the one shown in the body of the email without clicking on it but simply by hovering over it: the phishing links may resemble the official ones  but contain names and alphanumeric codes absent in the original.","10159504538444358_10159506311489358",

The masks are for a few reasons:

1) they are sick and dont want to infect others out of courtesy (people here sneeze and cough on everyone and everything or into their hands and then shake other peoples hands and touch handles and products. That why millions get infected every year if the flu and that’s why when the coronavirus gets here we are done for)

2) they are not sick and dont want to catch any infection from others

3) they have compromised immune system

4) environmental air quality is not good thus mask

For me I wear because of allergies. I also wear goggles as well. Zyrtec does not work. So when I go out I wear a face mask and goggles so I can breath and so that my eyes don’t get swollen shut. This happens 6 months out of the year for me.

However I take my mask and goggles off as I enter the building as a courtesy to others because I know it’ll freak people out.","10159063934926336_10159066563351336",

In 2018 the Trump administration fired the government’s entire pandemic response chain of command including the White House management infrastructure.

When you support a man having 3 wivesex-wives and shows no sign of changing. Donald is the only President who slept with prostitutes (cheated on all his pregnant wives).

He said he has never asked God for forgiveness in his life. donalds own dying mother gave him her Bible on her deathbed & donald still did not read it. If you talk about unborn then say they are being killed & murdered. donald locked up more than 50000 nos. of 3-4 year olds & another 53000 nos. of 5 -9 year olds for months on end since 2018 (approved by Kirstjen Nielsen)

You lost the right to ever talk about protect the constitution and the cost to pay the president bills pumping millions into his own private clubsresorts. Donald is using 255% more taxpayers money than his paycheck to charity.

U have lost the right to ever talk about law & order while giving powerful white house advisor seat to his family & in-laws. You lost the right to ever talk about anti-corruption while Republican cronies in Donalds administration end up in prison. Remember 8 years of Republican investigations into dems with nothing to show for. You have no ground to talk about dems accepting superPAC when republicans have allowed highest dark money from superPACs in history

U have lost the right to promising economic growth without a real plan to pay for trillions of tax-cuts Donald promised growth of at least 4% to 5% (even 6%) in his first term. Donalds 2nd term Debt will rise to 98% gdp if he keeps his 1.5 Trillion of tax-cuts & defense spending (your grandchildren will be paying long after donald is out of office). Why borrow so much from China & Feds cuts rates twice if economy is so good? Republicans who shut down the govt. because of the rising debt is now silent. Economic growth LBJ kennedy Clinton Obama ALL DEMS.

U have lost the right to about cheaper & better healthcare plan while Trumpcare is still vaporware. Or declaring never to cut and then try to cut SS Americans with Disabilities AIDs prorgams & education programs for low-income students Clean Water&Air Protection of Federal Lands (& even CDC when there is Coronavirus) & kill Ford motors.

U have lost the right to talk about spending or morality when Republican war on terror cost the taxpayers $6 trillion. It is time to stop equating military spending with patriotism that money could have been used to fix lead pipes fix healthcare rebuilding after natural disasters investing in infrastructure for 20 years. world biggest refugee intake (due to wars in middle east) has been into the poorest African & west Asian nations. Donald has got his 3rd wife the Einstein-class immigrant visa and got her parents as her dependent.

Didnt Donald invite Putin to Camp David for g6 meet? Syria was gifted to russia. failed Yemen & Niger raids. taliban are back in power in 75% of Afghanistan. Troops are not coming home but sent to protect the Royal saudis. donald-kim summit failed. The largest number of ambassadors posts vacancy in US history. Still No national intel chief & also No homeland security adviser. And fired 4 national security advisers!

You are in a time out. The worst are those who would switch to logic or faith whichever gives them a fig of justification in order to fight to hold on to Power. u cannot trust someone who said he kept mein kampf on his bedside. P.s. Tim Scott is the sole Republican Black politician in the congress.","10159065311816336_10159065921616336",

China keeps talking about hegemony of the US.
But China is engaged in illegal aggressionbrain-control on the world.
So counter-attack means of just countries should include open system rules.For example to depreciate the dollar.

Justice is distinction
A change in attitude is a fundamental change.The US should have much more than a lifetime of my darkness.but the US cannot delay China will ganged up with all countries.Therefore we should pay attention to the injustice of the European government now!

Counter-revolutionaries never talk about brain control
 China has ruled U.S. by controlling U.S. brain controller brain controllers control political figures in the US. Democratic Party has completely surrendered to china it will easily betray if its in power.
 So China chosed Andrewa Chinese as the next U.S. president. So third-rates are in politics Democrats deceive people with tolerant and multiple. Germany and France cooperated with them to turn world into china slave.

 One person to one country
 American politicians after leaving office have no protection and are arbitrarily maimed by China.
 After being abused the politicians who came to powerall obeyed China so the Democratic Party surrendered to China.
 The president has only a few staff members and his clothes are taken from his wardrobe. There are tens of millions of researchers in China’s core research institutions.
 Trump cant resist the sighting and murder of a country. China easily launches impeachment Trump begged for mercy: trade Kurdish Huawei......
 Because of the system the US is bound to perish.

 Because the Democrats have surrendered to China
 So the essence of the impeachment case is that Trump not only did not break the law but also worked hard to save the people and country.

 All good people will become right in this world
 Western leaders have completely surrendered to China They helped China kill the people and betray the country. The people are getting poorer and their bodies and minds are seriously damaged by China Brain control! Only bad people support their rule So they dont allow good people to survive. Good people who dont know the reason must be in their trap become extreme right.
 So Merkel is not fighting violence but helping China to kill Western people.

 The biggest characteristic of capitalism
 Even after Brexit Britain ’s moves are just some small businesses. The US-China trade agreement is a largest business but also a small business. So America and Europe are bound to perish.
 Trades of their ancestors were the biggest deals but their current trades are the smallest things.
 This is actually a question of capitalist heritage.

 Name studying
 This article only discusses events about names. In fact thats about a tool after the Chinese ruled the world and good people resisted China. Although the facts and logic temporarily support such conclusions but we are only talking about names.
 Presidents all over the world are chosen based on me now I finally noticed my unusualness!
 When I arrived in India Modis name surprised me if its called Confucius or Zhuangzi should be good. But “Modi” is must chinese must with Chinese support. Xi Jinping just admired the ancient Chinese scholar Modi.
 Cai yingwen the President of Taiwan is me and I have been banned from learning English by China all my life. Han guoyu is the chinese yu family that destroyed South Korea and killed all Westerners. Xi Jinping is Ma pingping my classmate with the same habits as me. So nominally I used to be Xi Jinping ’s group. I were called dragon (ron) Macron is the bad guy whos for attacking me. Merkel and Joko are You ke of yu family…...Names reflected whether the president is a good person.
 Bad presidents are supported by China they surrendered to China killed the people betrayed the country. They are dog legs of china for robbery and ruling world.
 British Prime Minister looks like xi jinping a cannibalism with brain control technology Iike Ben Johnson taking some stimulant. Now I be called Carl Lewis. Johnson used the power of Brexit to win parliamentary elections and then show his true face disrespectful of Trump at NATO Summit Counter-revolutionary acts this is a Chinese scheme!

 Our only weapon is western people
 The world is a political capitulation to China.Chinas economy is already invincibleand will soon do so militarily.China destroys culture by killing elites all over the world.Russia on which we are focused cannot do such a thing.

 Who made the coronavirus outbreak?
 No need to consider : this is an extremely useful stalling tactics of China China wants to transfer the evil to another and kill foreign people……
 Only need to consider: Did the better people die from the plague? If so then China made the plague.

 Why military elimination of China is the only way
 The crux of the West is the

- declaring yourself as leader of family values and having 3 wivesex-wives and shows no sign of changing. Donald is the only President who slept with prostitutes (cheated on all his pregnant wives).
- donald said he has never asked God for forgiveness in his life. donalds own dying mother gave him her Bible on her deathbed & donald still did not read it.
- talk about unborn then say they are being killed & murdered. Donald locked up more than 50000 nos. of 3-4 year olds & another 53000 nos. of 5 -9 year olds for months on end since 2018 (approved by Kirstjen Nielsen)
- projecting yourself as leader of law & order and giving powerful white house advisor seat to his family & in-laws 
- declaring yourself as leader who will protect the constitution and the cost to pay the president bills pumping millions into his own private clubsresorts. Donald is using 255% more taxpayers money than his paycheck to charity
- declaring yourself as leader of anti-corruption while cronies in your administration end up in prison. Remember 8 years of Republican investigations into dems with nothing to show for.
- declaring never to cut and then try to cut SS Americans with Disabilities AIDs prorgams & education programs for low-income students Clean Water&Air Protection of Federal Lands (& even CDC when there is Coronavirus) & kill Ford motors.
- promising economic growth without a real plan to pay for trillions of tax-cuts Donald promised growth of at least 4% to 5% (even 6%) in his first term.
- donalds 2nd term Debt will rise to 98% gdp if he keeps his 1.5 Trillion of tax-cuts & defense spending (your grandchildren will be paying long after donald is out of office). Why borrow so much from China & Feds cuts rates twice if economy is so good? Republicans who shut down the govt. because of the rising debt is now silent. Economic growth LBJ kennedy Clinton Obama ALL DEMS.
- lying about cheaper & better healthcare plan while Trumpcare is still vaporware. 
- talk about dems accepting superPAC when republicans have allowed highest dark money from superPACs in history
- minority support: republican Tim Scott is the sole Republican Black politician in the congress. u cannot trust someone who said he kept mein kampf on his bedside.

You are in a time out. The worst are those who would switch to logic or faith whichever gives them a fig of justification in order to fight to hold on to Power. 

P.s. Patriots and military: donald-kim summit failed. Syria was gifted to russia. failed Yemen & Niger raids. taliban are back in power in 75% of Afghanistan. Troops are not coming home but sent to protect the Royal saudis. The largest number of ambassadors posts vacancy in US history. Still No national intel chief & also No homeland security adviser. And fired 4 national security advisers! Didnt Donald invite Putin to Camp David for g6 meet? 

Republican war on terror cost the taxpayers $6 trillion. It is time to stop equating military spending with patriotism that money could have been used to fix lead pipes fix healthcare rebuilding after natural disasters investing in infrastructure for 20 years. world biggest refugee intake (due to wars in middle east) has been into the poorest African & west Asian nations. Donald has got his 3rd wife the Einstein-class immigrant visa and got her parents as her dependent.

1.5 Trillion of tax-cuts for stock brokers & golf course owners for next 10 years. US Farm bankruptcies went up 25% in 2019. Space Force will cost $13 billion. 1.5 million students (11%) have become homeless. Remember those lies about cheaper & better instead Trumpcare is still vaporware.

Just 3 people in US have more wealth than 63 million American families. People have more jobs but no money.

No this isnt just  like the flu. It is nothing like the flu.
Flu mortality rate this season is 0.05%.
Coronavirus mortality rate is pushing 4%.
That means if the coronavirus reached the same infection rate as the flu it would mean nearly one million dead in the US alone.
800 million dead globally.

This article only discusses events about names. In fact thats about a tool after the Chinese ruled the world and good people resisted China. Although the facts and logic temporarily support such conclusions but we are only talking about names.
Presidents all over the world are chosen based on me now I finally noticed my unusualness! 
When I arrived in India Modis name surprised me if its called Confucius or Zhuangzi should be good. But “Modi” is must chinese must with Chinese support. Xi Jinping just admired the ancient Chinese scholar Modi.
Cai yingwen the President of Taiwan is me and I have been banned from learning English by China all my life. Han guoyu is the chinese yu family that destroyed South Korea and killed all Westerners. Xi Jinping is Ma pingping my classmate with the same habits as me. So nominally I used to be Xi Jinping ’s group. I were called dragon (ron) Macron is the bad guy whos for attacking me. Merkel and Joko are You ke of yu family…...Names reflected whether the president is a good person.
Bad presidents are supported by China they surrendered to China killed the people betrayed the country. They are dog legs of china for robbery and ruling world.
British Prime Minister looks like xi jinping a cannibalism with brain control technology Iike Ben Johnson taking some stimulant. Now I be called Carl Lewis. Johnson used the power of Brexit to win parliamentary elections and then show his true face disrespectful of Trump at NATO Summit Counter-revolutionary acts this is a Chinese scheme!

Our only weapon is western people
The world is a political capitulation to China.Chinas economy is already invincibleand will soon do so militarily.China destroys culture by killing elites all over the world.Russia on which we are focused cannot do such a thing.

Who made the coronavirus outbreak?
No need to consider : this is an extremely useful stalling tactics of China China wants to transfer the evil to another and kill foreign people……
Only need to consider: Did the better people die from the plague? If so then China made the plague.

Why military elimination of China is the only way
The crux of the West is the election system Once a politician is elected he will use his power to develop his own interests. China took advantage of this feature and acquired all political leaders of the world. China is ruling the world. Politicians of various countries killed the people and destroyed the motherlands economy because they surrendered to China.
If there isn’t China on the world so the electoral system is not a big disadvantage the exchange of interests between capitalist countries is also not so dangerous.
Everything of China is bullying. China is not capable its only bullying. So China is the easiest woman to be defeated. It only fears force!

A contradiction
China says the world tide?in fact its aggression broke the pattern.
The weak have no chance of survival!We must choose some strong friends to defeat the biggest devil china.
Our key: for the reactionary ruleChina only uses foolsChina will conquer America.

Another contradiction
Western people are different from the bourgeoisie. None of western people is afraid of death but bourgeoise power figures are afraid of death in the face of Chinese aggression.
This is because of thinking spiritual level consciousness levels of both classes are different.
This is the most important contradiction in this world and this is a task of the Cultural Revolution.

The essence of capitalism
The spirit of capitalism is mercifulness but now the bourgeoisie has not inherited mercifulness. The ruling class has not big benevolence and real benevolence they fear war.

Counter-revolutionaries never talk about brain control
China has ruled U.S. by controlling U.S. brain controller brain controllers control political figures in the US. Democratic Party has completely surrendered to china it will easily betray if its in power.
So China chosed Andrewa Chinese as the next U.S. president. So third-rates are in politics Democrats deceive people with tolerant and multiple. Germany and France cooperated with them to turn world into china slave.

One person to one country
American politicians after leaving office have no protection and are arbitrarily maimed by China.
After being abused the politicians who came to powerall obeyed China so the Democratic Party surrendered to China.
The president has only a few staff members and his clothes are taken from his wardrobe. There are tens of millions of researchers in China’s core research institutions.
Trump cant resist the sighting and murder of a country. China easily launches impeachment Trump begged for mercy: trade Kurdish Huawei......
Because of the system the US is bound to perish.

Because the Democrats have surrendered to China
So the essence of the impeachment case is that Trump not only did not bre

Bulls Looking To Restructure Front Office Add Executive To Take Over Basketball Operations
FEB 17 2020 1:55 AM

Chicago Bulls president Michael Reinsdorf is researching candidates to take over the teams basketball operations league sources told Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN.

The current front office structure involving John Paxson-Gar Forman is unlikely to continue following this season adds Wojnarowski.

Joe Cowley of the Chicago Sun-Times reported that the Bulls are looking for a general manager with a louder voice and that conversations have been through back channels without any formal interviews.  

The goal is for Paxson to be given a different title within the organization with Forman moving to the teams scouting department.

CLOWNS!!!

They felt the pressure this weekend. Bulls fans lit them up on social media.

FireGarPax was trending in the US.

BULLS FAN ARE GOING TO RALLY BEHIND THIS SMOKE AND MIRROR CAMPAIGN.

Any restructuring with PAXSON and FORMAN still employed will be a FAILURE.

PAXSON AND FORMAN MUST GO!!

The article didn’t say anything about a new person taking over basketball operations. It said the franchise is looking for someone to be the public face of basketball operations. I.e Garpax don’t want to interface with the public any longer. There’s a big difference.

Pax has contributed a lot to the org especially in some lean years. But that was in the 1980s-1990s... he’s had a shot and maybe would be more successful elsewhere.

KEY POINTS
The flu remains a higher threat to U.S. public health than the new coronavirus.
THIS FLU SEASON ALONE has sickened AT LEAST 19 MILLION across the U.S. and led to 10000 DEATHS and 180000 HOSPITALIZED.
Roughly a dozen cases of the deadly coronavirus have been identified in the U.S. though the number has mushroomed across its outbreak zone in China.
While the new coronavirus ravages much of China and world leaders rush to close their borders to protect citizens from the outbreak the flu has quietly killed 10000 in the U.S. so far this influenza season.

At least 19 million people have come down with the flu in the U.S. with 180000 ending up in the hospital according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The flu season which started in September and can run until May is currently at its peak and poses a greater health threat to the U.S. than the new coronavirus physicians say. The new virus which first emerged in Wuhan China on Dec. 31 has sickened roughly 17400 and killed 362 people mostly in that country as of Monday morning.

“In the U.S. it’s really a fear based on media and this being something new” Dr. Jennifer Lighter hospital epidemiologist at NYU Langone Health said of the new coronavirus. “When in reality people can take measures to protect themselves against the flu which is here and prevalent and has already killed 10000 people.”

The coronavirus outbreak however is proving to be more deadly than the flu. It has killed roughly 2% of the people who have contracted it so far according to world health officials. That compares with a mortality rate of 0.095% for the flu in the U.S. according to CDC estimates for the 2019-2020 flu season. The CDC estimates that 21 million people will eventually get the flu this season.

“Two percent case fatality is still a tough case fatality when you compare it to the case fatality for the seasonal flu or other things” Dr. Mike Ryan executive director of WHO’s health emergencies program told reporters Wednesday.

“A relatively mild virus can cause a lot of damage if a lot of people get it” he added. “And this is the issue at the moment. We don’t fully understand it.”

Though some health-care professionals and analysts believe the number of coronavirus cases to be much higher which would mean a lower mortality rate.

“I think we’re going to find that the mortality number is going to be lower” Lighter said. “There is more than likely many times that number of people that have mild (cases) or are asymptomatic.”

“It may end up being comparable to a bad flu season” Lighter added.

If that’s the case that would bode well for the virus’s mortality rate pathogens specialist Dr. Syra Madad told CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” It would bring the mortality rate much lower she pointed out if there were 100000 cases and only 362 deaths rather than 10000 cases with 362 deaths.

“If we’re saying over 100000 cases the overall severity of the disease goes down” she said. “The risk to the general American public is low” Madad said though it’s still “very concerning.”

The two viruses have similar symptoms which some health officials fear will cause misdiagnoses. Common flu symptoms include fever cough sore throat and aches. Coronavirus symptoms include fever cough and shortness of breath according to the CDC.

For now Lighter stressed that the public should focus on the flu which is affecting children especially hard this season. She urged people to get their flu shots if they haven’t already and practice good hygiene. If they’re near someone sick she said to stand three feet away at all times.

KEY POINTS
The flu remains a higher threat to U.S. public health than the new coronavirus.
THIS FLU SEASON ALONE has sickened AT LEAST 19 MILLION across the U.S. and led to 10000 DEATHS and 180000 HOSPITALIZED.
Roughly a dozen cases of the deadly coronavirus have been identified in the U.S. though the number has mushroomed across its outbreak zone in China.
While the new coronavirus ravages much of China and world leaders rush to close their borders to protect citizens from the outbreak the flu has quietly killed 10000 in the U.S. so far this influenza season.

At least 19 million people have come down with the flu in the U.S. with 180000 ending up in the hospital according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The flu season which started in September and can run until May is currently at its peak and poses a greater health threat to the U.S. than the new coronavirus physicians say. The new virus which first emerged in Wuhan China on Dec. 31 has sickened roughly 17400 and killed 362 people mostly in that country as of Monday morning.

“In the U.S. it’s really a fear based on media and this being something new” Dr. Jennifer Lighter hospital epidemiologist at NYU Langone Health said of the new coronavirus. “When in reality people can take measures to protect themselves against the flu which is here and prevalent and has already killed 10000 people.”

The coronavirus outbreak however is proving to be more deadly than the flu. It has killed roughly 2% of the people who have contracted it so far according to world health officials. That compares with a mortality rate of 0.095% for the flu in the U.S. according to CDC estimates for the 2019-2020 flu season. The CDC estimates that 21 million people will eventually get the flu this season.

“Two percent case fatality is still a tough case fatality when you compare it to the case fatality for the seasonal flu or other things” Dr. Mike Ryan executive director of WHO’s health emergencies program told reporters Wednesday.

“A relatively mild virus can cause a lot of damage if a lot of people get it” he added. “And this is the issue at the moment. We don’t fully understand it.”

Though some health-care professionals and analysts believe the number of coronavirus cases to be much higher which would mean a lower mortality rate.

Sen. John Kennedy R-La. seemed dissatisfied with Homeland Security acting Secretary Chad Wolf as he peppered him with questions about coronavirus preparations during a Senate hearing on Tuesday.
Whos on first here? Whats on second? Kennedy said apparently referring to the classic comedy routine by Abbott and Costello.
He was in the middle of scolding Wolf for not knowing the answers to some of his questions many of which Wolf said could be answered by the Health and Human Services Department.
Kennedy at one point asked him how long it would take for the U.S. to obtain a vaccine for the deadly virus. Wolf said several months. Kennedy said he just heard testimony to the contrary and proceeded to reference the famous comedy routine.
Toward the end of his remarks Kennedy put it bluntly: Youre supposed to keep us safe and the American people deserve some straight answers on the coronavirus and Im not getting them from you.
CORONAVIRUS FITS CRITERIA FOR DISEASE X WHO EXPERT SAYS
I disagree Wolf responded. Kennedy also asked him whether the government had enough face masks and respirators to deal with an outbreak.
Do we have enough face masks? Kennedy asked. Wolf started responding by saying that DHS had enough masks.

Im not asking for the Department of Homeland Security Kennedy interjected. Im asking for the American people.
Wolf seemed confused asking in response: For the entire American republic? No I would say probably not.

Trump’s first budget proposal contained proposed cuts to the CDC that former Director Tom Frieden warned were “unsafe at any level of enactment.”
Congress mercifully didn’t agree to any such cuts but as recently as February 11 — in the midst of the outbreak — Trump proposed huge cuts to both the CDC and the National Institutes of Health.
Perhaps because his budget officials were in the middle of proposing cuts to disease response it’s only over this past weekend that they pivoted and started getting ready to ask for the additional money that coping with Covid-19 is clearly going to cost. But experts say they’re still lowballing it.
In early 2018 my colleague Julia Belluz argued that Trump was “setting up the US to botch a pandemic response” by for example forcing US government agencies to retreat from 39 of the 49 low-income countries they were working in on tasks like training disease detectives and building emergency operations centers.
Instead of taking such warnings to heart later that year “the Trump administration fired the government’s entire pandemic response chain of command including the White House management infrastructure” according to Laurie Garrett a journalist and former senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.

According to the Washington Post the basic premise of the Japanese plan is that the virus cant be stopped. Thats right: The Japanese are essentially acknowledging that the thesis proposed by Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch - ie that 70% of the worlds population might someday contract the virus - has at least some legitimacy.

One senior advisor who spoke with WaPo put it the starkest of terms: We cant stop it so the best we can do is keep the body count as low as possible.

We shouldn’t have illusions said Shigeru Omi a senior government adviser. We can’t stop this but we can try to reduce the speed of expansion and reduce mortality.","199237434762239_2656932577687336",

Security researchers have identified multiple phishing scams in which attackers pose as authorities like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the World Health Organization in emails offering information about the virus in order to trick victims into downloading malicious software or handing over their login credentials. One scam identified spreads false claims that the virus has spread to victims home cities then prompts users to enter their email passwords in order to read more information. Another scam teases similar information then uses malicious links to direct victims to a fake Microsoft Outlook portal that harvests credentials. The World Health Organization released an advisory last week urging people to stay on the lookout for phishing scams related to coronavirus…

the high taxes given to 
the gov. to control just about everything. The risk is high and who wants to work so hard just to give most of your profits to the government. People
loose their drive and ability to succeed and businesses fail. That is why most socialist economies fail unless
under authoritarian rule. If businesses fail
there are no jobs! Where in the world will
money come from to pay for all this stuff the dems are promising? If people arent making much the gov. cant collect that much in taxes. The only reason China has made money is because people are forced to work for almost nothing. The dems want a $15.00 minimum wage how do
we compete in manufacturing against
China who pays about
2 or 3 dollars for that kind of work. We used to care about human rights abuses in those countries now we send our manufacturing there to take advantage of their cheap labor. We
are now becoming dependent on China and others for goods which is very destabilizing. The coronavirus is just one example of how our economy can be negatively effected when we are so dependent on other
countries for goods.

We are about to go down the wrong path!!

MEANWHILE BACK IN REALITY Dr. Nancy Messonnier the director of the C.D.C.’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases told reporters that “it’s not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen.”

She said that hospitals and schools should begin preparing for an outbreak and that she had even spoken to her own family about “significant disruption of our lives.”

BY THE WAY Trump’s budget request for the fiscal year that begins in October would SLASH THE C.D.C.’s BUDGET by almost 16 percent and the Health and Human Services Department’s by almost 10 percent.

Alex M. Azar II the health and human services secretary told a Senate panel Tuesday that medical supplies were badly needed for the nation’s emergency stockpile including 300 million masks for health care workers alone he said.

The coronavirus has now infected more than 81000 people globally and killed more than 2700.

Trump’s sage advice and comprehensive plan? “There’s a very good chance you’re not going to die” Trump said about the outbreak at a news conference in India on Tuesday.","10159076197791336_10159076859186336",

By the time they have fever andor cough and goes to the hospital the lungs is usually 50 % Fibrosis and its too late!

Taiwan experts provide a simple self-check that we can do every morning:

Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing without discomfort stuffiness or tightness etc it proves there is no fibrosis in the lungs basically indicating no infection.

In critical times please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air!

SERIOUS EXCELLENT ADVICE by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases.  Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat is moist never DRY. Take a few sips of water every 15 mins at least. WHY?  Even if the virus gets into your mouth...drinking water or other liquids will WASH them down through your oesophagus and into the stomach. Once there in tummy...your stomach ACID will kill all the virus. If you dont drink enough water more regularly...the virus can enter your windpipes and into the LUNGS. Thats very dangerous.

Im Falle des Coronavirus wurde die Gefahr erkannt und entsprechend gehandelt. So wurde in China der Notstand ausgerufen mit Folgen: Plötzlich ist es egal ob die Notstandsmassnahmen einem Teil der Wirtschaft schaden. Denn niemand will eine Epidemie! Niemand will schuld daran sein dass Menschen sterben!

Beim Klimanotstand fürchtet man sich dagegen bereits vor dem Wort “Notstand”. Obwohl sich sicherlich keine Regierung riesige Schäden Millionen von Toten und das drastische Aussterben von Arten wünscht. Mit der Klimakrise verhält es sich aber nicht viel anders als mit einer Epidemie: Sind die Kipp-Punkte überschritten wird eine Eindämmung fast unmöglich. Deshalb brauchen wir den Klimanotstand und entsprechende Massnahmen. Dabei ist aber wichtig dass die Auswirkungen und Regeln verständlich sind und ohne Ausnahmen durchgesetzt werden.

Peter Schweizer on Bernie Sanders hypocrisy
Author and investigative journalist Peter Schweizer told Fox &amp Friends Wednesday that Sanders has more skeletons in his closet than his supporters are aware of.

The gap between the image Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt. portrays and the reality of how he conducts his own affairs is a major problem for his candidacy investigative reporter Peter Schweizer said Wednesday.

In an appearance on Fox & Friends with host Steve Doocy Schweizer explained that while the 2020 presidential candidate may talk about the common good his public service has benefitted his family financially over the years.

According to Schweizers investigations Sanders wife Jane Driscoll Sanders was appointed to several positions of influence when he was mayor of Burlington Vt. After the pair were married in 1988 she received a big pay increase — ignoring objections from the city council.

Bernie ignored them and that began this pattern of sort of steering money – taxpayer money and campaign money – to his family the Profiles in Corruption author said.

Schweizer said that shortly after his wife joined Sanders administration she set up a media buying business registered to the Sanders home in Vermont – despite having no previous experience in the field – and started doing media buying for her husbands campaign.

And the dirty little secret here is Steve when you do a media buy the buyer is entitled to a commission of between 10 and 15 percent Schweizer added. So it can be quite lucrative.

According to Schweizer at least $150000 was funneled to Jane Sanders though he stressed that the practice was not illegal. Doocy said the Sanders campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

In addition Schweizer said that allies of Sanders who ran for governor and lieutenant governor of the state of Vermont in 2000 and 2004 only received Sanders endorsement after they both hired his wife as their media buyer.

So he clearly seems to be leveraging his position for her business as well he remarked.

Delving further into Sanders history Schweizer told Doocy that his stock portfolio shows investments that arent socially responsible.

Hes not buying solar company stock or buying into an organic cattle farm. He is buying Fortune 500 companies. So he attacks Wall Street he attacks big pharma he attacks big oil...He is invested in those companies thats where he is actually putting his assets he stated.

So its a major problem for Bernie: this gap between the image he portrays and the reality of how he actually conducts his own affairs Schweizer concluded.

I didn’t actually vote for Trump. I voted for Pence.” True story. That’s how messed up some of these Trump voters are. That’s how many of them were thinking crazy thoughts!
Trump puts a man in charge of the corona virus that actually “ignored” health experts in Indiana on the spread of HIV until he could no longer ignore the issue bc the spread was real.

It was littered with falsehoods as documented by independent fact checking organizations. Here’s a sampling:

“We’re rapidly developing a vaccine and they can speak to you. … The vaccine is coming along well. And in speaking to the doctors we think this is something that we can develop fairly rapidly a vaccine for the future and coordinate with the support of our partners.”

Anthony S. Fauci the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told reporters any vaccine would not be “applicable to the epidemic unless we really wait about a year to a year-and-a-half.”

“The flu in our country kills from 25000 people to 69000 people a year. That was shocking to me. And so far if you look at what we have with the 15 people and their recovery. One is — one is pretty sick but hopefully will recover.”

The precise number of deaths annually from the seasonal flu isn’t known but estimates range from 12000 to 61000. In addition tens of millions of people come down with the flu each year and the fatality rate is 0.1 percent in the United States. The coronavirus appears to have a fatality rate that could possibly be 20 times higher. (Estimates are less than 3 percent.)

“I don’t think it’s inevitable that coronavirus will come to the United States. It probably will. It possibly will. It could be at a very small level or it could be at a larger level. Whatever happens we’re totally prepared.”

Trump contradicted Nancy Messonnier the director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases who a day earlier had said: “Ultimately we will see community spread in this country. It’s not a question of if but rather a question of when and how many people in this country will have severe illness.”","10159085554631336_10159085915281336",

A black president (Obama) while faced with a far more deadly pandemic (Ebola - a survival rate of only 10%-50%.) in the middle of a great recession caused by the previous administration was able not only to respond to the crises with a capable team of experts from the Center of Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) but also was able to do so without censoring information regarding the outbreak while putting our economy on the path to recovery without wrecking the stock market in the process.

Now under the Trump administration people with no knowledge of how to address a pandemic are put in charge information about the outbreak is being censored the stock market is seeing trillions of dollars in loses not seen since Bush drove the economy into recession and Trump is considering enacting a war powers act (THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT OF 1950) that would effectively make him a dictator in this country during peacetime while the result of his incompetent actions allows respondents to be exposed and infected for lack of protection thus contributing to spreading a pandemic across our country. (Coronavirus - the death rate among patients who were admitted to a hospital and received top level care is 4.3%. Mortality rate is estimated to be 5.3% for at-home self-care patients)

President Obama set up anti-pandemic programs in 47 vulnerable countries as a way to protect against something just like Coronavirus breaking out across the world.

Experts begged Trump to keep them open.

He closed 37 of them.

How Chinese and Europeans are rushed towards each other.

And again: the racist representation

A very malicious game is being played on the media.

On the one hand people are made aware of how afraid they should be of the coronavirus and people are even picked up with the police so that they can be locked up in quarantine against their will and tested whether they are carriers of the killer virus (although only the flu was renamed to spread panic) ... and even with parcels from China would have to be taken care of ... so a completely idiotic scenario was built ...

and on the other hand the same media mistakenly portray those manipulated as racists - and exaggerated who are really panicked by the media manipulation of all people and animals and things that could have this killer virus in them.

A Chinese school in Vienna has now closed - only because of the danger of COVID19 - without a single case in Austria - and this is fueling again.

From this racism against Chinese is then assumed for the Europeans and this in turn is widely disseminated in the Chinese media so that people are incited against each other.

The rushing on each other has really malicious reasons - and remember these media well - and no longer trust them. You have no good intentions with the people! Neither with the Chinese nor with us.

First of all this interacts with the targeted impoverishment of Europeans because China is an important supplier country - also for food. What is to be achieved through this jointly (!!) planned approach to the global economy (Chinas economy  politics against the Western economy is only played out) will follow in a later part.

Secondly the UN decided that drastic measures should be taken against fascist states - and the own media now describe the population as racist and promote this image.

At the same time there are the military exercises that are supposed to make the Europeans hostile to the people of Russia and China to make it even easier for us to kill their consciences and perhaps even to have them for the war scenarios that some world elite circles want.

PUT ON YOUR BIG BOY PANTS (IF YOU HAVE A PAIR).  WHAT GOOD HAS HE DONE OKAY I HAVE A FEW SECONDS.  Yale Center for Infectious Diseases reports the following (confirming what Bernie Sanders has for years proclaimed).  Doctors have discovered the benefits of Medicare for all i.e.:  

1.	68000  lives saved per year
2.	$450  billion savings per year 
3.	Expand healthcare choice by eliminating network barriers
4.	Eliminate health care loss
5.	Reduce drug costs

Trump’s 2020 budget outlines massive cuts to social security social security disability Medicaid and Medicare.

Remember people (who want to keep their present health care plan) when you retire get laid off (or fired) your health insurance benefits are lost immediately and you are on your own.  Fortunately I have ST of VT retirees’ insurance which paid 100% for my six hours of brain surgery (neurosurgeons are expensive) and a week recuperating in ICU pays 100% for my follow-up appointments (as the tumor can reoccur) costing over $10000 for three hours i.e. blood work MRI and a visit to the neuro-oncologist paid for my three hours of spinal fusion surgery and will pay 100% for my upcoming total knee replacement at Dartmouth  and recovery and physical rehabilitation.  I only pay a $25 co-pay for visits to the eye doctor dermatologist two physicals yearly mammograms colonoscopies (every five years) and comparable testing and 100% for blood tests.  Some states are now jailing people who cannot pay for their medical bills.  Think of the above could you afford all of these medical bills?”  I certainly could not and feel so fortunate to have this coverage for the rest of my life which you too will have WITH BERNIE SANDERS’ MEDICARE FOR ALL.

Amid warnings from public health officials that a 2020 outbreak of a new coronavirus could soon become a pandemic involving the U.S. alarmed readers asked Snopes to verify a rumor that U.S. President Donald Trump had “fired the entire pandemic response team two years ago and then didn’t replace them.”

The claim came from a series of tweets posted by Judd Legum who runs Popular Information a newsletter he describes as being about “politics and power.” Legum’s commentary was representative of sharp criticism from Democratic legislators (and some Republicans) that the Trump administration had ill-prepared the country for a pandemic even as one was looming on the horizon.

Legum outlined a series of cost-cutting decisions made by the Trump administration in preceding years that had gutted the nation’s infectious disease defense infrastructure. The “pandemic response team” firing claim referred to news accounts from Spring 2018 reporting that White House officials tasked with directing a national response to a pandemic had been ousted.

Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer abruptly departed from his post leading the global health security team on the National Security Council in May 2018 amid a reorganization of the council by then-National Security Advisor John Bolton and Ziemer’s team was disbanded. Tom Bossert whom the Washington Post reported “had called for a comprehensive biodefense strategy against pandemics and biological attacks” had been fired one month prior.

It’s thus true that the Trump administration axed the executive branch team responsible for coordinating a response to a pandemic and did not replace it eliminating Ziemer’s position and reassigning others although Bolton was the executive at the top of the National Security Council chain of command at the time.","10158360503473984_10158363477558984",

President Trump is responsible for everything bad since the beginning time!

The Democrats and the Mainstream Media seem almost giddy at the possibility of the coronavirus making Trump look bad. 

There is a serious mental health issue in America. Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS) is a mental condition in which a person has been driven effectively insane due to their dislike of Donald Trump to the point at which they will abandon all logic and reason.
Symptoms for this condition can be very diverse ranging from hysterical outbursts to a complete mental break. TDS can also often result in the sufferer exhibiting violent homicidal or even genocidal desires.
Sufferers have also been known to wish direct self harm on themselves (such as increased taxes a desire for an economic recession and even nuclear war) provided that a action might in some way hurt Donald Trump.
TDS started out as a joke but sadly showing some real truth.","494818004795647_760884804439351",

Coronaviruses are a group of common viruses. They are named for the crown-like spikes on the surface of the virus. Some coronaviruses only affect animals but others can also affect humans. Most people get infected with human coronaviruses at some time in their life. They usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory infections like the common cold. But they can also cause more severe illnesses such as bronchitis and pneumonia.
There are several different types of human coronaviruses including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses.","3446784485358956_3448071985230206",

Later China joined in their invasion with the help of some middle eastern actors (possibly Iranians). Their mission was to take over the United States by deploying a new technology. This technology was microchips that were able to be manipulated in the bloodstream and powered by electromagnetic fields. The strength of the weapon is that nearly everyone infected excluding myself has no knowledge that their brain is receiving wifi signals which can control movements hearing vision body functions production of mucous etc. but most importantly the weapon is able to send signals to the brain that someone who is infected perceives to be their own thoughts. The President was one of the first infected. Ways to know your infected: 1. if your skin feels itchy  look for a small particle moving slowly on the skin. if you see that particle you are infected with the weapon. 2. possible blood test for abnormally high emf readings in the blood. 3. brain imaging: this may prove difficult given the fact that the weapon I believe was made hard to detect by standard medical testing and is possibly plant based. There were Russian microbiologists here studying plant morphology however I cannot confirm if this test would show the existence of such chips. They are able to overpower existing neural electrical impulses with a combination of emf radiation and high powered signals. The coronavirus since it originated in China is possibly not real but disinformation. The stating of a fake virus could be to manipulate the stock markets and capitalizing on the downturn in the market due to the belief there is a pandemic and most likely to further deploy the weapon through airborne particulates (sprays.supposedly disinfectant but really containing emf powered microchips-infection through the sinus canal) vaccinations and tests which pierce the skin. The second group of tests causing blood contamination. Once contaminated operatives (many of them) are needed to manipulate the microchips to their appropriate places to enable the brain to receive the wifi signals. In many instances neural paths (or artificial neural paths) are fused together with a high powered electromagnetic charge. The reason they are saying the coronavirus is all over the world is because they have deployed the weapon all over the world and it enables mind control and infiltration. The flow of information can be greatly controlled with this weapon for obvious reasons. see Lloyd Trapezoid facebook page and Lloyd_Trapezoid Twitter davestilman8 instagram for more information.","10156626851946607_10156627107986607",

1. If you have a runny nose and sputum you have a common cold
2. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose.
3. This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 2627 centigrade degrees. It hates the Sun.
4. If someone sneezes with it it takes about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne.
5. If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours - so if you come into contact with any metal surface - wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap.
6. On fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. normal laundry detergent will kill it.
7. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice.
8. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes but - a lot can happen during that time - you can rub your eyes pick your nose unwittingly and so on.
9. You should also gargle as a prevention. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice.
10. Cant emphasise enough - drink plenty of water!
THE SYMPTOMS
1. It will first infect the throat so youll have a sore throat lasting 34 days
2. The virus then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and then the lungs causing pneumonia. This takes about 56 days further.
3. With the pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty in breathing.
4. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You feel like youre drowning. Its imperative you then seek immediate attention.

1. If you have a runny nose and sputum you have a common cold
2. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose.
3. This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 2627 centigrade degrees. It hates the Sun.
4. If someone sneezes with it it takes about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne.
5. If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours - so if you come into contact with any metal surface - wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap.
6. On fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. normal laundry detergent will kill it.
7. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice.
8. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes but - a lot can happen during that time - you can rub your eyes pick your nose unwittingly and so on.
9. You should also gargle as a prevention. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice.
10. Cant emphasise enough - drink plenty of water!

I have determined you are a liar or terribly mis-informed. Your remark about Obama’s  era being better than bush’s.  Wrong. Bush economy was fair due possibly to the war.  Obama inherited at least a fair economy and trashed it along with his hideous apologies overseas for our USA. He is a Muslim who wants this nation to be a third world nation and then mass killings of Christians so he can have another Muslim nation. Then came Trump—. The economy is better than it has been since 1980 or earlier. The stock market has been higher than ever in US history. Yes it dropped due to the coronavirus scare but came back full blown today.

Exhibit 1-
The coronavirus seems to be more deadly than the flu — so far.

On average seasonal flu strains kill about 0.1 percent of people who become infected. The 1918 flu had an unusually high fatality rate around 2 percent. Because it was so contagious that flu killed tens of millions of people.

Early estimates of the coronavirus death rate from China the epicenter of the outbreak have been around 2 percent. But a new report on 1099 cases from many parts of China published on Friday in The New England Journal of Medicine finds a lower rate: 1.4 percent.

A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association from China’s CDC reported that the case fatality rate (CFR) in approximately 45000 patients with confirmed Covid-19 in mainland China was 2.3%

President Trump is responsible for everything bad since the beginning time!

The Democrats and the Mainstream Media seem almost giddy at the possibility of the coronavirus making Trump look bad. 

There is a serious mental health issue in America. Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS) is a mental condition in which a person has been driven effectively insane due to their dislike of Donald Trump to the point at which they will abandon all logic and reason.
Symptoms for this condition can be very diverse ranging from hysterical outbursts to a complete mental break. TDS can also often result in the sufferer exhibiting violent homicidal or even genocidal desires.
Sufferers have also been known to wish direct self harm on themselves (such as increased taxes a desire for an economic recession and even nuclear war) provided that a action might in some way hurt Donald Trump.
TDS started out as a joke but sadly showing some real truth.","2552539065000134_133481678191580",

PREVENTATIVE SOLUTIONS  CRITICAL THINKING
1.	Wash hands frequently and wear N95 mask “properly” they even come in various colors and styles.
2.	Don’t touch face kids!  Primary avenue of infection is mouth.
3.	Clean high traffic surface areas daily.
4.	Vitamin C Zinc and antiviral homeopathy.
5.	Isolate and evaluate for 24 days if possibility of exposure (travel to known outbreak region or area).

FACTS
1.	Math = 6 out of 102 infections have died as of 03-02-19 in US. (6% is high as most had underlying health issues believe to be 2-3% mortality).
2.	Advanced care would be 15-20% of those infected (NJM).
3.	Majority of children ages 2-16 are normally asymptomatic for duration (NOT ALL).
4.	0-27 (24 WHO) days before symptomatic.
5.	2-14 days incubation.
6.	In orders of magnitude much higher mortality rate than Flu (A&B) which is .1%.

WHO SHOULD BE CONCERNED (NOT PANIC)
1.	Smokers
2.	Those with asthma
3.	Diabetics
4.	Those with autoimmune disorders
5.	Infants >2yrs

MORAL OF THE STORY IS WEAR MASKS WASH HANDS FREQUENTLY LIMIT RISK!!!    If everyone did these three things for a period of 6 months we would not even have a flu season next year!  LOL","10158369814883984_2560457467554239",

He cut federal funding to the CDC just before the Coronavirus started in this country.  And takes money from the military funds for his wall. He campaigned  on how he would create thousands of great paying jobs with rebuilding the infrastructure. Yet he hasn’t done anything about that. He campaigned he had a really really great healthcare plan all ready to go if elected. It would be a really great rate and anyone who needed it could get it.  The first  two years in office he had a gop majority in the congress and the senate and still failed to develop a working plan.  He said he wouldn’t eliminate preexisting conditions in healthcare.  Yet that is going to be decided in the Supreme Court by a case filed by republicans. And now today it was announced the whole AHCA Obama care will be heard by the Supreme Court to eliminate it altogether. And the would mean 24 million people would lose their health care.

Da könnten sie Recht haben aber es geht ihnen doch gar nicht ums Coronavirus oder? 

Das kann man auf ihrem Facebookprofil lesen: 
Hört Euch das an. Ich hoffe so langsam begreift Ihr dass das eine riesen Verarsche mit dem CO2 Hype ist.

Ob etwas dumm ist oder nicht interessiert sie also offensichtich nicht sonst würden sie nicht die Realität leugnen. Es geht doch bloss darum eine Gruppe zu verunglimpfen die sie als Feind wahrnehmen weil diese Gruppe sie daran erinnert was bei ihrem Motorrad hinten aus dem Auspuff kommt und was das für Auswirkungen auf die Welt hat. 

CO2 ist nunmal ein Treibhausgas und erwärmt somit den Planeten wenn die Konzentration in der Atmosphäre steigt. Das Absorptionspektrumum von CO2 lässt sich exakt messen. Das geht soweit. dass wir jede Absorptionslinie dieses Moleküls kennen. Genauso sind die physikalischen Gesetze bekannt um den Einfluss von CO2 auf die Temperatur der Erde zu berechnen. Diese Gesetze sagen ein atmosphärische Rückstrahlung durch CO2 in ganze spezifischen Wellenlängen voraus. Eine klare Vorhersage die mann messen kann. Was stellt man fest? Diese Rückstrahlung gibt es nicht nur sondern sie hat genau den Wert und kommt in den Wellenlängen vor die die Berechnungen aus der Physik vorhersagen. Genauso kann man über die jährlichen Schwankungen des CO2 Gehaltes genau messen wieviel die atmosphärische Rückstrahlung zu oder abnimmt. wenn die CO2 Konzentration in der Atmosphäre sinkt oder steigt. Auch das stimmt exakt mit der Physik überein. 

Dumm ist also bloss ihre Aussage dass es sich hierbei um einen Hype handle. Physik ist kein Hype. Man kann nunmal beweisen dass die gesamte globale Erwärmugn seit 1950 von CO2 und zu kleineren Teilen vom Methan stammt. Das mag ihnen nicht gefallen aber die Natur interessiert sich nicht dafür was ihnen gefält. Wenn wir jetzt falsch handeln setzen wir die ganze Welt einer unglaublichen Gefahr aus und riskieren unglaublichen und irreversiblen Schaden.","1617133658434378_1617286551752422",

The claim came from a series of tweets posted by Judd Legum who runs Popular Information a newsletter he describes as being about “politics and power.” The commentary is representative of sharp criticism from Democratic legislators (and some Republicans) that the Trump administration has ill-prepared the country for a pandemic even as one is looming.
Legum outlined a series of cost-cutting decisions made by the Trump administration in preceding years that gutted the nation’s infectious disease defense infrastructure. The “pandemic response team” is a reference to news stories from spring 2018 reporting that White House officials tasked with directing a national response to a pandemic had been ousted.
Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer abruptly departed from his post leading the global health security team on the National Security Council in May 2018 amid a reorganization of the council by then-National Security Advisor John Bolton. Ziemer’s team was disbanded. Tom Bossert who as The Washington Post reported “had called for a comprehensive biodefense strategy against pandemics and biological attacks” had been fired one month prior.
It’s true that the Trump administration axed the executive branch team responsible for coordinating a response to a pandemic and did not replace it eliminating Ziemer’s position and reassigning others although Bolton was the executive at the top of the National Security Council chain of command at the time.
Legum stated in a follow-up tweet “Trump also cut funding for the CDC forcing the CDC to cancel its efforts to help countries prevent infectious-disease threats from becoming epidemics in 39 of 49 countries in 2018. Among the countries abandoned? China.” That was confirmed in 2018 reports saying that funding for the CDC’s global disease outbreak prevention efforts were cut by 80% which included the agency’s efforts in China.
On Feb. 24 2020 the Trump administration requested $2.5 billion to address the coronavirus outbreak an outlay critics said might not have been necessary if the previous cuts had not taken place. On Feb. 26 Fortune reported that:
The cuts could be especially problematic as COVID-19 continues to spread. Health officials are now warning the U.S. is unlikely to be spared even though cases are minimal here so far.
“It’s not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country any more but a question of when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness” Dr. Nancy Messonnier the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said during a press call on Feb. 25.
The coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan China in the winter of 2019. Since then cases have spread around the globe. The U.S. has 57 confirmed cases as of this writing. Globally roughly 80000 patients have been sickened with the virus and 3000 have died. As of yet there is no vaccine or pharmaceutical treatment. Data from China suggests the coronavirus has a higher fatality rate than the seasonal flu although outcomes depend on factors like the age and underlying health of the patient.","10159103774636336_517859398934507",

The Austin public health committee was wrong this morning saying there is low risk and contradicted themselves.

They said the risk of spread in Austin is low.

Then immediately after said the mortality rate is likely the similar to the flu as there are many mild cases undetected which skew the reported rate higher. 

Despite the WHO saying the exact opposite yesterday. 

WHO: Globally about 3.4% of reported COVID19 cases have died. By comparison seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected

https:twitter.comwhostatus1234872254883909642?s=21

How can you say these two things back to back while claiming this is “evidence based”? 

You literally just made up an indeterminate amount of undetected cases to fit your narrative of it being ok to keep large gatherings ongoing. 

The risk of spread is low somehow but there also probably a bunch of cases out there we don’t know about spreading the virus. It doesn’t make any sense.

There now appear to be two divergent strains of coronavirus being spread. L-cov and S-Cov.

One is much more aggressive spreads faster and is newer. The older one which originated in Wuhan seems to be less so. We have idea what strain could be spread here.

This is not being taken into account when discussing containment measures here.

Das Programm für den internationalen Frauen*kampftag vom 7. & 8. März 2020 findet in Zürich wie geplant statt! Wir machen uns gerade in «Krisenzeiten» für Feminismus stark!
Das Coronavirus versetzt viele Menschen in Alarmstimmung:  Unsere feministische Antwort auf diese “Krise” lautet auf zur Frauen*demo und auf zum feministischen Streik am 7. und 8. März 2020! Die   Doppelmoral   der   Coronavirus-Politik   hat   Medico   International   in   ihrem   Statement   schön beschrieben:  “Das  Muster  ist  einfach:  Erst  wenn  eine  Krankheit  die  Grundlagen  der  globalen Wirtschaftsströme   bedroht   und   auch   die   Menschen   in   der   First   und   Business   Class   der ‘Weltgemeinschaft’  betrifft  gibt  es  plötzlich  enorme  Mittel  die  für  die  chronischen  Hungerleider  der Welt (...) nie zur Verfügung stehen” (Medico International). Auf einmal fliessen Millionen während in der Forschung der Pflege der Betreuung in der Altersvorsorge und bei den Löhnen gespart wird. Es wird für die “innere Sicherheit” aufgerüstet während geflüchtete Menschen in menschenverachtenden Lagern  wohnen  müssen.  Ausserdem  steht  die  Bedrohung  die  vom  Coronavirus  ausgeht  in  keinem Verhältnis  zur  medialen  Panikmache.  Masern  Tuberkulose  oder  Malaria  fordern  jährlich  viel  mehr Tote und niemand spricht darüber -der Unterschied? Das Coronavirus trifft den globalen Norden die kapitalistischen Zentren.In  ebensolcher  Manier  vollzieht  der  Bundesrat  nun  eine  Notfallübung.  In  der  “Verordnung  über Massnahmen  zur  Bekämpfung  des  Coronavirus  (COVID-19)”  hält  er  fest  “Massnahmen  gegenüber der Bevölkerung zur Verminderung des Übertragungsrisikos des Coronavirus (COVID-19) zu treffen” (Verordnung  des  Bundesrats).  “Gemäss  Art.  2  dieser  Verordnung  tritt  ein  Veranstaltungsverbot  für öffentliche  und  private  Veranstaltungen  bei  denen  sich  gleichzeitig  mehr  als  1000  Personen aufhalten”  in  Kraft  (Stadtpolizei  Zürich).  Als  explizit  verbotene  Veranstaltungen  werden  jedoch ausschliesslich  solche  des  Freizeitbereiches  aufgeführt: FasnachtDemonstrationen  Fussballspiele. “Grosse  Bürogebäude  Einkaufszentren  Märkte  Museen  oder  Bahnhöfe  mit  insgesamt  mehr  als 1000 Personen sind davon also nicht betroffen” (Stadtpolizei Zürich). Es gibt viele Gründe warum wir uns dem Verbot der Frauen*demonstration am 7. März sowie der Streikversammlungen am 8. März widersetzen: Stellt  man  sich  die  Frage  wo  überall    Ansteckungsgefahren  lauern  lässt  sich  eine  ganze  Reihe  an Situationen  definieren.  Die  grösste  Ansteckungsgefahr  herrscht  gemäss  Massnahmenkatalog  des Bundes  da  wo  sich  Menschen  die  Hände  reichen  wo  Gegenstände  die  Hände  wechseln  und  wo Menschen  sich  direkt  anniesen  weil  sie  eng  beieinander  stehen  oder  sich  gegenüber  sitzen. Tatsächlich  ungeschützt  und  ausgesetzt  sind  demnach  zum  Beispiel Detailhandelsangestelltein Supermärkten die Geld aus zehntausenden Händen entgegennehmen. Direkt ausgesetzt sind somit auch Pendler*innen zu Stosszeiten Pflegekräfte in Spitälern und Heimen oder Betreuer*innen in Kitas und Schulen. Die  Beispiele  zeigen  auf  dass  der  Bund  an  erster  Stelle  die  Wirtschaft  schützt  und  nicht  die Bevölkerung.  Denn  die  vielleicht  am  meisten  ausgesetzte  Detailhandelsangestellte  wird  nicht  ins Zentrum  der  Schutzmassnahmen  gestellt.  Solange  dies  nicht  der  Fall  ist  solange  Supermärkte Bahnhöfe  und  Pendlerzüge  nicht  reorganisiert  werden  müssen  sehen  wir  keinen  Grund  warum Veranstaltungen  die  draussen  und  dazu  noch  in  Bewegung  sind  an  denen  man  den  Abstand  zu anderen  Menschen  selbst  regulieren  kann  nicht  stattfinden  sollen.  Umso  mehr  rufen  wir  Personen die in Pflege Betreuung Sexarbeit Reinigung Gastronomie Verkehr oder Detailhandel arbeiten zum Streik auf da sie möglicherweise in unseren Aktionen besser vor einer Ansteckung geschützt sind als in ihrem Arbeitsumfeld.

Typically Republicans vote to cut things like food stamps (SNAP-Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) healthcare including CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program) and money for clean air and clean water.  And they have plans to cut Social Security and Medicare.  In other words anything that helps the weakest among us.

The socialism that Republicans vote in favor of are such things as more funding for the Pentagon than the Pentagon even requests huge subsidies for the oil and gas industries and huge bailouts for farmers hurt by Trump’s trade war.  Oh and Trump’s Wall is taxpayer funded so it’s socialist.

Dean Koontz was one of my favorite horror novelists when I was growing up. What I liked the best about his stories was the way he interjected shadowy government organizations into his narratives. Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus the writer has become a topic of discussion on social media because of the plot of his 1981 effort The Eyes of Darkness.
Why would a 39-year-old book suddenly be in the public eye again? Well apparently some fans think that Koontz may have predicted the onset of the virulent virus strain. When you think about it it doesn’t seem farfetched but it may just be a coincidence.

The Eyes of Darkness is about Tina Evans a grieving mother who cannot get over the death of her son Danny. A year after his untimely demise she starts dreaming of him. One day she goes into his room to find a message written for her on his chalkboard NOT DEAD. She goes on a quest to find out if her son has truly passed away.
This novel was originally printed in 1981 under Dean Koontz’s nom de plume Leigh Nichols. It was reprinted in 1989 under his given name. Why do I mention this fact? Because it is important to note for the Coronavirus prediction theory.
The Facts:
In the 1989 version of The Eyes of Darkness Wuhan-400 originated in Wuhan China just like the Coronavirus. However it is a biological weapon and was created by a scientist named Li Chen. The Leigh Nichols 1981 novel has the biological weapon virus being manufactured in Russia and it was named Gorki-400.
Snopes the well-known debunking site also calls out the mortality rate of Wuhan-400. For dramatic purposes Koontz’s virulent strain has a 100% mortality rate. According to World Meters the Coronavirus is a tentative 2% rate and is subject to change as more information is gathered on the virus.
Another point of contention that would render Koontz’s prediction more along the lines of coincidental would be in reference to the incubation period for Wuhan-400. His timeframe is four hours where World Meters states 2-14 days. However there have been two reported cases of the Coronavirus where the incubation time was 24 days and 27 days. Apparently depending on the patient that statistic can vary.","2551876194922204_2552180594891764",

Last evening dining out with friends one of their uncles whos graduated with a masters degree and who worked in Shenzhen Hospital (Guangdong Province China) sent him the following notes on Coronavirus for guidance:
1. If you have a runny nose and sputum you have a common cold
2. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose.
3. This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 2627 degrees. It hates the Sun.
4. If someone sneezes with it it takes about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne.
5. If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours - so if you come into contact with any metal surface - wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap.
6. On fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. normal laundry detergent will kill it.
7. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice.
8. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes but - a lot can happen during that time - you can rub your eyes pick your nose unwittingly and so on.
9. You should also gargle as a prevention. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice.
10. Cant emphasise enough - drink plenty of water!
THE SYMPTOMS
1. It will first infect the throat so youll have a sore throat lasting 34 days
2. The virus then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and then the lungs causing pneumonia. This takes about 56 days further.
3. With the pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty in breathing.
4. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You feel like youre drowning. Its imperative you then seek immediate attention.

Here. Ill help you Jason.

For the flu:
”On average seasonal flu strains kill about 0.1 percent of people who become infected.

Compared to COVID-19:
Early estimates of the coronavirus death rate from China the epicenter of the outbreak have been around 2 percent. But a new report on 1099 cases from many parts of China published on Friday in The New England Journal of Medicine finds a lower rate: 1.4 percent.

So to repeat death from flu and related complications are 0.1. Death from COVID-19 and related complications are somewhere around 1.4-2.0.

Now Im pretty sure you know how to compare two numbers to tell which are larger. But your multitude of fallacious  commentsreplies scattering this whole page doesnt lend you much credibility.
 And I seriously have a gut feeling youll give me the FAKE NEWS run-around. So Ill say your cognitive dissonance does not make reality how you view it.

This is real this is dangerous this can easily be MUCH worse than the flu.
Do your research listen to qualified scientists read actual studies.

And lastly wash your hands more often.","10157101806333994_10157104708838994",

LOL Trump never donated any of his money to anybody. In Fact just this past fall the Trump charity Foundation was forced to close down by a NY judge because it was proven Trump spent over 2.2 million dollars of the foundations money collected for childrens cancer for his own personal use.  One NY attorney general said Trump spent the money like it was his own personal piggy bank.. His children moved the money from one bank account to another to make it available to their dads spending. Judge ordered Trump to pay back the 2.2 million dollars and he was fined millions of dollars. His children can not be on another foundation board for at least 10 years in the state of NY.. This was in every news paper in the country and even on all TV news media......Oh I forgot Trump told his supporters that was all fake news....LOL Further more if google and research Trump and his family you will find out he declared bankruptcy 5 times stiffing banks investors contractors and even workers of millions and millions of dollars. Trump made his money through corruption of cheating his entire life....NO Bank in the U.S. has lent him money since the late 1990s because of his corrupted businesses.  That is when he turned to Russia for financial aide.  Deutsche Bank lent Trump money when no other bank in the world would lend him money. Thats why Trump blocked Congress from getting his bank documents from Deutsche Bank . Trump is under investigation for bank fraud and money laundering with Deutsche Bank....another fact.  He bankrupted his Atlantic City casinos which were heavily fined for money laundering........google the facts.... His yearly salary is only $400 thousand dollars. He makes millions and millions off the tax payers money on his and his childrens travel alone.  He charges the tax payers millions of dollar for the security that stays at his golf club which he visits almost every month. ......So his $200 thousand dollar quarterly salary wouldnt make a scratch he spends more tax payers money then that monthly  You have to laugh at the people who believe these stories.

Once again I (Maureen) see a Great Flame that I have come to know as the Heart of God the Father. He says: The most effective way to expose Satans work is to reveal it for what it is. He hides behind fear. These days he is using the coronavirus as a means of striking fear in the heart of the world. Areas hardest hit by this disease deserve to take every precaution. However fear is consuming the hearts of those not even affected yet. Evil is using this virus to weaken people not only physically - but also emotionally and spiritually. People now fear receiving the Holy Eucharist* when it is a source of spiritual and emotional strength. Now is the appropriate time to embrace the sacraments even to a far greater degree than ever. Your greatest strength is not avoiding crowds washing your hands or even a new vaccine although these are all positive steps in attempts to remain healthy. Your greatest strength is the sacramental Eucharist which Satan is now attacking through fear. 

Fighting this virus must not include weakening the population spiritually. Stand united and courageous in your attempts to remain spiritually strong. Church leaders take note and do not lead your flock astray in an untimely fashion.

And Trump was shutting off travel to and from China while Schumer was calling him a xenophobe and trying to impeach him. If you remember Schumer was the one who leaked those letter to the public and caused IndyMac to go under. Yes in a weeks time the run on the bank put it into bankruptcy. He has also caused this run on the financial markets. And as long as events get shut down people are ordered to stay home itll feed on itself. Then he goes out and announces that Trump cant come up with a vaccine for 18 months further scaring more ill-informed people causing more of a panic in the market. What he doesnt tell you is that all vaccines are 18 months behind. The ones youre taking today is for the virus that was active 18 months ago. Those with money have no problem with this crash.

I know he was focused on impeachment when Trump shut down China. Yet Schumer has stated that he was too late. Others called him a xenophobe for picking on China. Maybe you dont agree with the time it takes to get a fully tested vaccine out. First they have to do the development in a lab. Then after theyre fully satisfied they need to get that into a live human. Once thats done they need to observe for about 4 months. Then they test it on a bigger sample after making adjustments. Once theyre satisfied then its ready for the general population. Did you disagree that Schumer caused the market crash? Perhaps he wasnt solely responsible but that was his intent just as he caused IndyMac to go under. People are making money in this market shorting it as it dives and covering at a lower price.

With covid-19 there is no vaccine program for coronavirus that can be used to quickly address it. Also the swine flu had a mortality rate of the normal H5N1 flu which is a minimum of 20 times less than covid-19. Had nothing to do with who the president was other than the previous administration had a clear and concise message on swine flu. This administration has had no consistent messaging. One day the president says it is contained then calls it a hoax then says it will miraculously go away in April then says we will have a vaccine in 3 to 4 months while his own CDC says minimum 1.5 years then says it is no big deal and then says it is contained but not airtight and the FDA is consistently denying use of test kits to prevent solid confirmed numbers from being reported. I was GOP for 23 years but this administration forced me out of the party because of the consistent idiocy it displays on a daily basis with every issue or subject. As hard as I fought against Obama in 08 and 12 have to say I would take him or Bush back in a heartbeat over this trainwreck administration.","10159104969096336_616542452235867",

“The CDC has labeled the current Coronavirus outbreak as a serious public health threat but one where the immediate health risk to the general American public is considered low. By contrast the flu virus is very active at this time of year. It is important to take preventive actions to reduce the risk of all viral transmissions.

First of all please pray for those infected by the coronavirus (now renamed Covid-19 by WHO) in China and around the world for those who care for them for health specialists and authorities who are combating the spread of infection and of course for all who at this time are feeling anxious especially for those with friends and family in China and Italy.

Also please consider some adjustments as we continue celebrate our liturgies. While it is our faith that the sacraments are means of grace and not of sickness they are physically ministered and we should take physical care. Therefore here are some suggestions for all of us to consider:

• Refrain from physical contact during the Sign of Peace (note: the Sign of Peace can be exchanged without physical contact)
• Refrain from receiving of Holy Communion via the chalice (we will still offer Communion via the chalice in the central aisle for any parishioners with celiac disease or sensitivity)
• Given the frequency of direct contact with saliva in the distribution of Holy Communion on the tongue we invite all parishioners to receive Holy Communion reverently in open hands for the time being.
• Refrain from holding hands during the Lord’s Prayer.
• Refrain from using Holy Water fonts”.","10159104596886336_509177136397915",

In his opening remarks at the March 3 media briefing on Covid-19 WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated:

“Globally about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 cases have died. By comparison seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected.” 13

Initial estimate was 2%

Initially the World Health Organization (WHO) had mentioned 2% as a mortality rate estimate in a press conference on Wednesday January 29 12 and again on February 10. However on January 29 WHO specified that this was a very early and provisional estimate that might have changed. Surveillance was increasing within China but also globally but at the time it was said that:

We dont know how many were infected (When you look at how many people have died you need to look at how many people where infected and right now we dont know that number. So it is early to put a percentage on that.12).
The only number currently known is how many people have died out of those who have been reported to the WHO.
It is therefore very early to make any conclusive statements about what the overall mortality rate will be for the novel coronavirus according to the World Health Organization 12.","3464957740208297_3465313390172732",

All homes and businesses would be insulated creating jobs cutting fuel poverty and reducing emissions. Electric car charging points would be installed across the country. 

A frequent flyer levy for regular overwhelmingly affluent air passengers would be introduced. As Turner says all government policies will now be seen through the prism of coronavirus. A similar climate lens should be applied and permanently.

...

There is a key difference between coronavirus and climate crisis of course and it is shame. “We didn’t know coronavirus was coming” says Stirling. “We’ve known the climate crisis was on the cards for 30 or 40 years.”

Coronavirus poses many challenges and threats but few opportunities. A judicious response to global heating would provide affordable transport well-insulated homes skilled green jobs and clean air. Urgent action to prevent a pandemic is of course necessary and pressing. But the climate crisis represents a far graver and deadlier existential threat and yet the same sense of urgency is absent. Coronavirus shows it can be done – but it needs determination and willpower which when it comes to the future of our planet are desperately lacking.

And while your at it you should tell your doctor that  you will not be needing one of those stupid tests either.

THINK AGAIN.

Trump had over a months notice to react when China (who now produce 1.6 million tests kits per week) was

originally infected and he chose to call the criticism of his inaction a....HOAX.....as his strategy was it

will disappear with the coming warm weather of April.

BUT:

No worries folks as Trump has got us all covered with the capacity to test about 400 per day as of last week

Other nations have tested patients by the tens of thousands.

China has probably tested millions.

How come the South Koreans can do 10000 tests a day and we can’t?

On Monday 32  following mounting criticism of the federal response the Trump

administration officials finally promised a rapid expansion of the country’s testing capacities.

Why weren’t more Americans tested sooner?

How many may be carrying the virus now?

Most disturbing of all:

Did a failure to provide adequate testing give the coronavirus time to gain a toe hold in the

United States?

The incompetence has really exceeded what anyone would expect with the C.D.C.” said Dr.

Michael Mina an epidemiologist at Harvard University.

New kits were released over the past weekend and more are on the way  Alex M. Azar the

secretary of health and human services said on Sunday.

Its so comforting that we have Trump and Azar being so ...PROACTIVE.... protecting our citizens

health and welfare.

Do you think that our strategy can be described as criminal so far below the level of so many other

counties?

Testing may well become more widespread in the next few weeks....TO LITTLE TO LATE.... as the

virus will have spread beyond our capacity to contain it.

And so as a result it may not help contain the coronavirus if it is being spread by people who are

asymptomatic.","10159110443216336_222680238920935",

Within the overall proposed cuts detailed on Feb. 10 for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was a reduction in spending to guard against “emerging and zoonotic diseases” from $635772000 to $550464000. 
Zoonotic diseases are those that have crossed from animals to humans as the novel coronavirus is believed to have done. The $85308000 proposed budget cut is less than the cost of 5 miles of border wall.

The budget proposal would save the cost of another 2 miles of border wall by zeroing out a $40 million funding line for the Epidemic and Lab Capacity Program. The ELCP supports state labs that monitor health emergencies at the local level. A state lab in Texas confirmed the first case of Ebola in the U.S. in 2014. 
For the cost of less than 7 miles of border wall the proposed budget would leave all of us less protected against a potential epidemic. The Trump administration made its priorities even more explicit when Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar discounted a suggestion that border wall funds could be diverted to fight the spread of the coronavirus. 
We might have had earlier warning of the outbreak but previous budget cuts caused the CDC to end its global security program in China in 2017.
In another failure of foresight two years ago the White House eliminated the National Security Council’s position for combating global health crises. The NSC’s Senior Director for Global Health Security and Biothreats post was held by the highly regarded Rear Admiral Tim Ziemer—whose sudden departure in May of 2018 happened to coincide with a new Ebola outbreak in Africa.
That outbreak proved to be no threat to America so most of us quickly forgot about it. So what if there was no longer anybody on the security council to guard against such threats? And as long as the rich are getting their tax breaks and the stock market is booming who cares if the CDC is being cut year after year?
But fear of this new bug caused the stock market to tank this week. And worrisome news came on Wednesday even as Trump was insisting there is little cause to worry because of his bold prescient leadership. 
California made the startling announcement that a resident of Solano County had tested positive for novel coronavirus without having traveled abroad or coming in contact with somebody known to be infected. The chronically underfunded public health system had needed four days to make the diagnosis as the swab had to be sent to the CDC which is hampered both by a shortage of tests and reliability problems with the ones it does have.
Trump Spends 45 Minutes With ‘Deep State’ Play Actors Amid Coronavirus Mayhem
We can only hope that the doctors were able to get as much information as they could from the patient before she was intubated. One near-certainty is that she got it from somebody who is still out there.
Our Germophobe-in-Chief should consider that a president is as vulnerable as anybody else to a virus. President Woodrow Wilson was stricken while visiting France during the Spanish flu pandemic early in the last century. Wilson survived but some historians believe he suffered lasting neurological damage that became apparent at the negotiating table making for considerably less art to his dealing.
Wilson could have just as easily caught the flu at the White House. And the present viral threat could arrive there as easily as any other place with a cough or a shaken hand.
During  Wednesday’s press conference Trump announced that he was putting Vice President Mike Pence in charge of responding to the threat.

Nobody who is aware of Pence’s role in enabling an HIV outbreak when he was governor of Indiana could have been rightly heartened by his new role. But one hopeful sign came when Pence enlisted the help of a physician scientist who has been leading the national fight against HIV. Dr. Deborah L. Birx  will now direct the effort against novel coronavirus. She is held in nearly as high esteem as Rear Admiral Ziemer but she is only now being put in place. Ziemer would have already been on the case had he not been pushed out. 
Other hopeful news came with word that state laboratories across the country are poised to start testing for novel coronavirus. That effort will initially require $25 million which is all but sure to be allocated now that Trump is suddenly prepared to answer the threat with bigger than big bucks
But the time to hire a fire chief and fund firehouses is before a fire.

Trump claimed We got hit with the virus really three weeks ago if you think about it I guess. Thats when we first started really to see some possible effects.
Facts First: The US had its first confirmed case of the coronavirus on January 21 more than six weeks before Trump spoke here so its not true that the US had not really seen even some possible effects until three weeks ago.
Obama and coronavirus testing
Trump repeated his claim that he had reversed an Obama-era decision that had somehow impeded testing for the coronavirus saying They made some decisions which were not good decisions. We inherited decisions that they made and thats fine ... We undid some of the regulations that were made that made it very difficult but Im not blaming anybody.
Facts First: There is no regulation from President Barack Obama that impeded coronavirus testing. The Obama administration did put forward a draft proposal related to lab testing but it was never implemented. When asked what Obama administration decision Trump might be referring to Peter Kyriacopolous chief policy officer at the Association of Public Health Laboratories said: We arent sure what rule is being referenced. Dr. Joshua Sharfstein who was principal deputy commissioner of the FDA under Obama and is now professor of the practice at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health said There wasnt a policy that was put into place that inhibited them.

Please continue to go to work attend Trump rallies shake hands with each other (hell how ‘bout a big ol’ MAGA wet kiss!) and cough and sneeze openly on each other just to show we snowflakes how much smarter than us you really are.

And while your at it you should tell your doctor that  you will not be needing one of those stupid tests either.  After all because of Obama there aren’t enough to go around and there won’t be a vaccine (as if you’d be caught dead pandering to the fear- mongering Democrats and admit concern) or medicine to treat the virus for possibly 18 months.

You see some of us suffer from the delusion that scientists are our friends and that their years of study and exquisite knowledge tells them exactly what is really going on.  I know I know.  Some of us have not yet evolved to your superior level of intellect.  Please try to understand our senseless worrying!

You have a golden opportunity before you.  You should gather together for two solid weeks...sort of a self imposed MAGA quarantine...and talk about how brilliant you all are to have chosen the smartest man in America to lead you through this crisis (which he has aptly labeled a “Democratic hoax”).  If you really love and trust your President you should refuse testing refuse medical attention and refuse to be drawn into the ridiculous rantings of a pandemic coming from the left.  

You should allow anyone who wants a test to have one before you since the whole thing is a joke anyway.  This would allow you to stand proudly in solidarity with your leader and laugh and jeer at folks like me who think the sky is falling.  

You should avoid hospitals already overflowing with reactionary hypochondriacs and minorities nursing a little sniffle.

And please for the sake of your brilliant fearless leader do not wait in some ridiculous line for a test or a vaccine.  After all your better than that!","10159110443216336_824708881328331",

And Im supposed to crap myself because a few people died from Coronavirus??
Sorry to sound cold but were being PLAYED by the Democrats and the Mainstream Media!!
Statistically THIRTY THOUSAND (30000) people have died in the US from influenza for the period 2018-2019.
For the prior year over SIXTY THOUSAND (60000) people died.
And yet it was NOT considered a Pandemic!  Fear and doomsday panic didnt grip the nation! The stock market didnt fall to the pit of hell in a weeks time and the Pope didnt crap in his Depends!
So Whats different now?
Its election season and the Democrats know they cant keep Pres.Trump from being re-elected. All other attempts to take him down have failed!
The only candidates the Democrats have are ones suited for the Nursing home or the Psychiatric Ward!
Which only further proves the Democrats and their media goons & ghouls are behind all the hype and fear of this so called pandemic!
The bark of this is far worse than the bite!
Im not underestimating a serious medical issue.

As of today about 100000 people all over the world as gotten the coronavirus and out of those 100000 57000 are all free of it now. That’s more then half already back to being healthy and virus free. 
The people who have died because of the corona virus are all in the risk groups (sick elderly etc). But the media won’t mention that of course. 
The panic over the corona virus is brought to you by the media. They’re reporting about it 247 and it’s bringing in lots of money for them. 
The regular flu  which changes types every year is far more dangerous and actually kills A LOT more people every year. 
And just to give you even more statistics the high peaks of the regular flu is about 8 weeks. Ergo less then the time the coronavirus has been going on and the regular flu kills a lot more people. Every year.

My opinion is that in the 21st century we’ve had two illegitimate Republican presidents.  Bush’s 1st term was brought to us by the Republicans on the Supreme Court and Trump was brought to us by Russia.  But I could forgive that if either of them were good presidents.

Under Bush we got the Iraq War brought to us by lies torture a botched response to Hurricane Katrina and the Bush Economic Bust.

Under Trump so far we have Trump’s total incompetence in the Coronavirus update not only with his initial bad decisions but also with the stupid things he continues to say in contradiction with the medical professionals.

1. How much money is our government planning to spend to fightprevent this? The US just announced 8.3 billion. 
2. How many ICU beds and respiratory ventilation machines do we have in Canada? 
3. In the case of a mass outbreak without any measures to stop visitors from entering how will our medical resources (ICU beds respiratory ventilators drugs etc) going to be allocated among our own residents and visitors from other countries? I dont see Canada as a nation that would turn sick people away we even let hundreds of pregnant women into our country to give birth to receive free citizenship for their babies every  year of course we wont turn away coronavirus patients. But what would that mean for tax players in Canada? 
4. With China and other countries stopping exports of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals and APIs how is Canada going to respond in the case of an outbreak? Do we manufacture our own supplies? 
5. Health Canada persist that Canadas risk is low. But the number of infected cases are growing daily! At what point do you think that HC will change their narrative? Until we reach triple digit or quadruple digit? Is that the goal that HC is aiming for by not taking more preventative
measures?  
6. What if the virus causes a massive outbreak as a result of the lack of preventative measures? Who would be held accountable? The Health Minister Ms Hadju or yourself Mr. Trudeau? Would the both of you be willing to step down if your current efforts to downplay the affect of the virus were to cause a high casualty due to lack of awareness among the public and lack of medical resources? 
7. How accurate are the test kits for covid19  even the CDC in the US admitted that many in the first batch of test kits had been faulty and test results were not all that accurate..do we have the same issues in Canada?
8. Why are we not given more information on the recovered patients and those who are still struggling with the virus? What treatments or medications were used to help the recovery? Did they suffer severe symptoms? And do they develop anti bodies after recovery? In China there are reports of reinfected cases is that what we should expect if we catch it...?

I hate to sound critical or distrusting of your government but I am sure that I am not the only one who questions your down playing of the virus! We are in the information era and we get news about what is happening in other advanced countries and what others are doing to prevent and minimize the cost of a potential outbreak! And they are doing more than telling ppl to wash their hands! Some governments are even putting in money to build manufacturing lines for medical masks due to Chinas export ban! 

So if you dont want to cause panic the best practice is always honesty and openness. The Canadian public is very intelligent we can tell when our government is sincere with us or not. I know that you greatly admire the Chinese communist style regime but most Canadians dont and the last time I checked we are still a democracy and the government is still meant to serve our best interest and not to rule over us! If you want to hide the truth younwould need to spend 70 years closing off our country in order to brainwash the population so I am sorry to tell you as.much as you like to start manipulating the media it aint gonna work! And I am so glad to see that you only have 3 more years to be PM or maybe less of you keep going down this path....

You must know that Canadians have the capacity to digest the truth no matter how bad it is and we are willing to work together to fight this but only if your government is willing to be honest! And I am sorry to say that to date I have been very disappointed!","10158650502085649_197633534663937",

China is in a much worse state than they are admitting to the world due to the coronavirus. 

Taking over the top measures is the correct course of action when dealing with a potential pandemic. 

Do not just take the stance opposite of the left for the sake of opposing the left rather use critical thinking and sound judgement. 

Also a recession is due a central banking system like the federal reserve requires a system reset every 7 years. Its been put off by Trump. This is why before the federal reserve if the US government used a central bank it was a contract for like 20 years. The last resets were masked usually by going to war. 

The stock market is mostly held up by speculation it can turn on a dime. 

Trump used the same number skewing as obama to bolster the economy. Cannot just go off the stock market to judge the economy you gotta look at like retail sales car sales home ownership etc. retail sales last i checked dropped by 7%. Cars are being manufactured but not sold full car lots everywhere. This economy is an illusion and trumps doing this on purpose. 

Fed interest rates were almost at 0% for obama but the fed jacked up rates and when the rates hit over like 1.75% its a 100% chance of recession following. In october the fed rates were at 2%. 

Trump created this illusion economy so when it does crash and burn all the blame goes to the fed reserve and the US government can take back control of US currency which is better for every American.","3467535169950554_3467701879933883",

Trumpworld Vs. Coronavirus. Feb. 26 2020

For the United States the answers are especially worrying because the government has intentionally rendered itself incapable. In 2018 the Trump administration fired the government’s entire pandemic response chain of command including the White House management infrastructure. In numerous phone calls and emails with key agencies across the U.S. government the only consistent response I encountered was distressed confusion. If the United States still has a clear chain of command for pandemic response the White House urgently needs to clarify what it is...

I’m genuinely shocked. With the pandemic coming now is not the time for the Democrats to turn on Trump. But when this is over if it has been bad...then Trump will deserve everything they throw at him.

They are currently giving people experimental drugs andor HIV medicines to try and beat it. Its also extremely contagious (actually going up from 2 to 1 to 3 to 1 infection rate now.) Keep telling yourself its a common cold though! 

Theres no reason to panic. Sure most will survive but trust me its no common cold and you dont want to get it. Your immune system is the ONLY way you can beat it. In other words youre basically on your own. I hope youre healthy enough for that because you cant pop some pills and fix it if you do get it. 

Im a musician and in fact Ive played SXSW several times over the years and I live here right in the thick of it. Im as bummed as everyone else about it being canceled but we live to fight another day. Common sense is common sense. For example NYC just announced thousands in quarantine now and they cant even get them all tested yet. The government (state and local) are playing catch-up. Thats not the time to be throwing festivals. Period.

If someone got coronavirus at SXSW you can bet it would be the last time there was a SXSW. It would be sued into oblivion. Thats not worth the risk either. Notice the insurance for SXSW does NOT cover Bacterial infections Viruses Communicable Diseases and Pandemics. Thats because they cant control it. No insurance in their right mind would insure against that.","10157106890833994_10157113060073994",

Now there is a new and insidious danger.
https:www.governing.comtopicshealth-human-servicesgov-hookah-bars-public-health.html

Its impossible for retail service industry and healthcare workers a large portion of the workforce to work from home. They have to be where the customers and patients are therefore its imperative to immediately identify then eliminate the highest risks for community spread of 2019-nCoV in advance and one of those is person to person contact with saliva at hookah lounges and shisha bars.
Iran has the highest COVID-19 death toll of any country outside of China where it started so now they ban hookahs which are very popular in their country.

Hookah a hit with Iranian youth
Smoking water-pipes is an age-old tradition with roots in Iran and India but its recent resurgence in popularity among young Iranians is raising alarm bells with health professionals...

Iran coronavirus outbreak may be worse than thought:
https:www.vox.com202022621153438coronavirus-iran-outbreak-pandemic

The actual number of people in Iran infected with COVID-19 is far higher than reported.
https:time.com5791516iran-doctors-coronavirus-middle-east

https:www.cnbc.com20200225iran-highest-coronavirus-death-toll-outside-china-accused-of-cover-up.html

Rapid development of a vaccination against it combined with strict steps to prevent person to person transmission of it can block a COVID-19 pandemic.
The response to unknown source community spread of 2019-nCoV must include stopping dangerous gatherings as several countries have already done by closing schools canceling concerts worship services and sports events but especially shutting down hookah bars where distinctly deliberate random frequent protracted  and close contact exchange of saliva occurs. 
Its like the tobacco substance abuse version of an orgy without condoms or a shooting gallery sharing needles.
Contagious diseases ranging from herpes to hepatitis to respiratory infections like tuberculosis coronaviruses and influenzas can be spread person to person by hookah waterpipe sessions which typically last over an hour therefore state governments and local jurisdictions can declare public health emergencies then shut down hookah parlors.

CDC:
Hookah smoking is typically done in groups with the same mouthpiece passed from person to person.1234...

hookah cafés are gaining in popularity around the world including Britain France Russia the Middle East and the United States.1...

* Hookah smokers may be at risk for some of the same diseases as cigarette smokers. These include:34
    * Oral cancer
    * Lung cancer
    * Stomach cancer
    * Cancer of the esophagus
    * Reduced lung function
    * Decreased fertility...

Hookah waterpipes are reservoirs for pathogenic microbes:
Contagious diseases ranging from oral herpes to the flu might be passed along and more dangerous illnesses such as tuberculosis and hepatitis have been linked to Hookah use.....

Wiping or replacing the hookah mouthpiece between users is futile because the hose and bowl are still contaminated with microbes some of them probably pathogenic.

COVID19 has stricken people in countries where hookah smoking is popular with dozens of deaths in only a short time:

Trump’s Misplaced Blame on Obama for Coronavirus Tests - FactCheck.org

Amid criticism over his administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak President Donald Trump falsely claimed that he had to overcome an Obama-era Food and Drug Administration “rule” to more quickly provide diagnostic tests to the American people. Experts however told us no such formal regulation was ever implemented under the previous administration.

WASHINGTON EXAMINER

Coronavirus is exposing Trumps unsuitability to handle a crisis

by Philip Klein

President Trump’s bombastic style has served him well through many stages of his political career but as the coronavirus spreads rapidly throughout the United States it is exposing how deeply unsuited he is to deal with a genuine crisis that he can’t bluff his way through.

It’s one thing for Trump to insist he had a “perfect” phone call and have all his Republican minions fall in line. It’s another thing to downplay a growing epidemic as more and more Americans get sick.

On February 26th Trump patted himself on the back for the relatively low number of cases in the U.S. “You have 15 people and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero that’s a pretty good job we’ve done he said. By March 5 he was tweeting that the U.S. had “only 129.” Just a day later he said there were 240 cases portraying this as a low number relative to the seasonal flu

Sunday morning he avoided stating any number in touting “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus. We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas which was a Godsend. V.P. is doing a great job. The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. Sad!”

As of this writing Johns Hopkins has tracked 428 cases in the U.S.

When Trump was elected many of his critics feared that he could talk the U.S. into a nuclear war. Those fears have not been realized as Trump has proven generally averse to military conflict actually more averse than many of his predecessors. He’s also overcome a number of scandals through a combination of relentless attacks on the media and his political enemies and overreach among his opponents in both camps. But this is something different. Trump will be judged on his handling of the spread of a virus. And the outcome will be clear no matter how many things he makes up no matter how confident he pretends to be and no matter how many insults he heaves.

If anybody was hoping that Trump had the ability to rise to the moment his comments upon touring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should disabuse them of that notion.

Trump speaking from the facility with a red “Keep America Great” campaign hat found time to praise the ratings of his townhall interview on Fox News. He declared “I don’t watch CNN because CNN is fake news.” He attacked Washington Gov. Jay Inslee who is dealing with the most deadly coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. as a “snake.”

Dipping into the greatest hits from his impeachment defense Trump said of the CDC tests that have run into significant problems “the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”

When it came to the matter of testing Trump also lied and revealed staggering ignorance. In the face of questions about the disastrously slow rollout of testing in the U.S. Trump insisted “Anybody that wants a test can get a test. That’s what the bottom line is.”

That is not remotely true. There have been many stories of people’s futile efforts to try and get tested. Last Thursday for instance a registered nurse exhibiting symptoms in quarantine after having cared for a coronavirus patient wrote of her difficulty obtaining a test even after it was okayed by a local health official.

Here in Washington DC where the first case was announced Saturday health officials said they had the capacity to test 50 people a day. There is currently restrictive criteria for who can get tested.

South Korea in contrast has set up drive through centers where individuals can get a sample taken in a few minutes without getting out of their cars and get results back within a few days. This is exactly the sort of outside the box innovative solution that one would think a guy who ran as a practical businessman type would want to encourage or at least look into. Instead Trump said “they’re not testing. They’re sampling people in other countries.”

When a reporter interjected that those samples are then being tested Trump said “No no — excuse me there’s a difference. I heard what he said. They’re sampling people. It’s a drive-by. They give samples. Now can we do that? Yeah we can do that but that’s not effective like what we’re doing.”

The lack of adequate testing may be keeping the numbers of identified cases artificially low in the U.S. but they are also preventing public health officials from being able to identify areas of outbreak early enough to take steps to mitigate the spread. The more that we can make the spread of the virus more gradual the easier it will be to make sure that we have enough medical capacity to treat the cases of those who require hospitalization. From what we saw in China the

“A lot of things are happening. Our economy is doing fantastic. We got hit with the Coronavirus and that was a surprise. I started hearing about it very quietly a couple of months ago from China. Against the advice of a lot of professionals I closed the borders to China that’s why we have a very small number of people that we have to worry about” said the President.

“I closed the borders against the advice of a lot of people and it turned out to be a very wise decision. Otherwise we would have had a lot of people coming in during the course of a number of weeks” he added.

Are you going to deny that he said I like the numbers being where they are. I dont need to have the numbers double because of one ship?

The numbers on the Diamond Princess hit 700 because Japan kept it off shore for weeks rather than disembarking and placing people into isolated quarantines. And Trump thinks magically because the ship isnt docked it wont affect US numbers? He cares more about the numbers? You cant objectively see that this is stupid decision?

Trumpworld Vs. Coronavirus. Feb. 26 2020

For the United States the answers are especially worrying because the government has intentionally rendered itself incapable. In 2018 the Trump administration fired the government’s entire pandemic response chain of command including the White House management infrastructure. In numerous phone calls and emails with key agencies across the U.S. government the only consistent response I encountered was distressed confusion. If the United States still has a clear chain of command for pandemic response the White House urgently needs to clarify what it is...

I’m genuinely shocked. With the pandemic coming now is not the time for the Democrats to turn on Trump. But when this is over if it has been bad...then Trump will deserve everything they throw at him.

Trumpworld cannot be so stupid as to stay on the “media conspiracy” story while all this is going on can it?”

First Trump blew the preparation by canceling Obama’s pandemic response team.

“Trump Has Sabotaged America’s Coronavirus Response

Now Trump needs to BE QUIET.  White House officials have advised Trump to let the experts do the talking but according to insiders he thinks his doing the talking is good for him politically.  It’s always all about himself.

Yet he is spewing out so much misinformation.  

TRUMP SAID “The 15 people with Coronavirus within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.”

TRUMP SAID  on HannityFox March 4 2020
?“We have thousands or hundreds of thousands of PEOPLE THAT GET BETTER JUST BY you know sitting around or EVEN GOING TO WORK some of them go to work.”

TRUMP SAID of the Democrats’ criticism of the administration’s handling of the Coronavirus “this is their new hoax.

TRUMP SAID this is Obama’s fault.
Trump’s Misplaced Blame on Obama for Coronavirus Tests - FactCheck.org
https:www.factcheck.org202003trumps-misplaced-blame-on-obama-for-coronavirus-tests

TRUMP SAID that he doesn’t want to let the Americans on the cruise ship off of the CA coast disembark even if they are put in quarantine because “I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault.”

TRUMP SAID on March 7 2020  “anyone who wants a test can get a test.”

At least Pence is finally showing some guts and is willing to contradict Trump.

We dont have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward Pence admitted to reporters.

So have you got that?  TRUMP blows the initial response so he responds by telling people there’s no problem (it will be zero people go to work while sick and get better and anyone who wants a test can get one) BUT  it’s not his fault (it’s a hoax it’s Obama’s fault and “I” don’t want the ship to double our numbers because it’s not our fault).","10159121244911336_10159121610911336",

The American Conservative
Trumpworld Vs. Coronavirus. Feb. 26 2020

For the United States the answers are especially worrying because the government has intentionally rendered itself incapable. In 2018 the Trump administration fired the government’s entire pandemic response chain of command including the White House management infrastructure. In numerous phone calls and emails with key agencies across the U.S. government the only consistent response I encountered was distressed confusion. If the United States still has a clear chain of command for pandemic response the White House urgently needs to clarify what it is...

I’m genuinely shocked. With the pandemic coming now is not the time for the Democrats to turn on Trump. But when this is over if it has been bad...then Trump will deserve everything they throw at him.

Trumpworld cannot be so stupid as to stay on the “media conspiracy” story while all this is going on can it?”

I do think it is on us as individuals to think sensibly and react appropriately.

So because of this we do need leaders to set an example and help those who won’t think sensibly. 

Yes I had heard we can have it and not be very ill or not I’ll at all. So we can certainly be carriers. This makes me concerned for those who are in nursing homes or hospitals or home bound do to other issues because we could pass it along.

Stop comparing an event that ran its course to another event that is on going.
The Reason the Coronavirus is scary is because it is expending no one has it under control. No one knows how bad it can get and how to stop it. 
In the USA no one knows how many people are infected. As of now it could be hundred of thousands. Just the cruise ship. Out of 1000 people the moron in chief only had 40 or  50 people tested. Half of them were positive.
In short we know Jack about this virus. Why are kids not affected? The flu usually affect kids. Is it True that even after being infected you still have no immunity against it? Which mean a vaccine might not work. If you have no idea about something how much of an idiot are you to believe it is under control?

U.S. President Barack Obama waited until millions were infected and thousands were dead before declaring a public health emergency concerning swine flu the H1N1 virus.

First it is a flu is devastating when people get really sick they need weeks of ICU – and second because of how fast and effectively it spreads. There is 2 week incubation period and many who have it never show symptoms.

When Prime Minister Conte announced last night that the entire country 60 million people would go on lock down the line that struck me most was “there is no more time.” Because to be clear this national lock down is a hail mary. What he means is that if the numbers of contagion do not start to go down the system Italy will collapse.

Why? Today the ICUs in Lombardy are at capacity – more than capacity. They have begun to put ICU units in the hallways. If the numbers do not go down the growth rate of contagion tells us that there will be thousands of people who in a matter of a week? two weeks? who will need care. What will happen when there are 100 or a 1000 people who need the hospital and only a few ICU places left?

On Monday a doctor wrote in the paper that they have begun to have to decide who lives and who dies when the patients show up in the emergency room like what is done in war. This will only get worse.

There are a finite number of drs nurses medical staff and they are getting the virus. They have also been working non-stop non-stop for days and days. What happens when the drs nurses and medical staff are simply not able to care for the patients when they are not there?

And finally for those who say that this is just something that happens to old people starting yesterday the hospitals are reporting that younger and younger patients – 40 45 18 are coming in for treatment.

You have a chance to make a difference and stop the spread in your country. Push for the entire office to work at home today cancel birthday parties and other gatherings stay home as much as you can. If you have a fever any fever stay home. Push for school closures now. Anything you can do to stop the spread because it is spreading in your communities – there is a two week incubation period – and if you do these things now you can buy your medical system time.

And for those who say it is not possible to close the schools and do all these other things locking down Italy was beyond anyone’s imagination a week ago.

Soon you will not have a choice so do what you can now.

Please share.","1542951925856433_226445968728768",

President Trump acted immediately to restrict travel test at airports and quarantined those infected or exposed. 20000 have already died from the flu this year in the U.S. Last I heard less than 100 people have died from the Coronavirus. Mostly elderly with pre-existing conditions. But keep drinking the kool aid and watching the fake news.","10158401459343984_544495399522705",

I am writing to you from Bergamo Italy at the heart of the coronavirus crisis. The news media in the US has not captured the severity of what is happening here. I am writing this post because each of you today not the government not the school district not the mayor each individual citizen has the chance today to take actions that will deter the Italian situation from becoming your own country’s reality.  The only way to stop this virus is to limit contagion. And the only way to limit contagion is for millions of people to change their behavior today. 

If you are in Europe or the US you are weeks away from where we are today in Italy.

I can hear you now. “It’s just a flu. It only affects old people with preconditions”

There are 2 reasons why Coronavirus has brought Italy to it’s knees. First it is a flu is devastating when people get really sick they need weeks of ICU – and second because of how fast and effectively it spreads. There is 2 week incubation period and many who have it never show symptoms.  

When Prime Minister Conte announced last night that the entire country 60 million people would go on lock down the line that struck me most was “there is no more time.” Because to be clear this national lock down is a hail mary. What he means is that if the numbers of contagion do not start to go down the system Italy will collapse. 

Why? Today the ICUs in Lombardy are at capacity – more than capacity. They have begun to put ICU units in the hallways. If the numbers do not go down the growth rate of contagion tells us that there will be thousands of people who in a matter of a week? two weeks? who will need care. What will happen when there are 100 or a 1000 people who need the hospital and only a few ICU places left? 

On Monday a doctor wrote in the paper that they have begun to have to decide who lives and who dies when the patients show up in the emergency room like what is done in war. This will only get worse. 

There are a finite number of drs nurses medical staff and they are getting the virus. They have also been working non-stop non-stop for days and days. What happens when the drs nurses and medical staff are simply not able to care for the patients when they are not there?

And finally for those who say that this is just something that happens to old people starting yesterday the hospitals are reporting that younger and younger patients – 40 45 18 are coming in for treatment. 

You have a chance to make a difference and stop the spread in your country. Push for the entire office to work at home today cancel birthday parties and other gatherings stay home as much as you can. If you have a fever any fever stay home. Push for school closures now. Anything you can do to stop the spread because it is spreading in your communities – there is a two week incubation period – and if you do these things now you can buy your medical system time. 

And for those who say it is not possible to close the schools and do all these other things locking down Italy was beyond anyone’s imagination a week ago. 

Soon you will not have a choice so do what you can now. 

Please share.","10159132033321336_242752563551484",

The reason they’re using coronavirus as a scare tactic for the trade deal is.
???
September 26: The Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese retaliatory tariffs on lumber and wood products had caused hardwood lumber exports to China to fall 40% during 2019 resulting in American lumber mills slashing employment.184

Which is cut things that have normal necessities like toilet paper. And because these products are not available because of the trade deal.
You’re able to make a case for a pandemic.

And you have companies that will cut supply in the US just to get rid of the president.

And if you know anything about manufacturing they typically have a 6 to 12 month supply overstock.
