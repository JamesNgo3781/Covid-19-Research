  content : Forex and Cryptocurrency Forecast for January 27 - 31, 2020\n\n \nFirst, a review of last week’s events:\n  \n- EURUSD. The euro is falling again, and it has lost about 70 points to the dollar over the past five days. There are two reasons for this: the coronavirus epidemic in China and the very cautious new ECB Head Christine Lagarde.\nIt is well known that the Eurozone economy is strongly correlated with the Chinese economy, as has recently been demonstrated by the trade wars. And if the economy of China is sick, then the European one is also experiencing a strong malaise. In 2003, a pandemic in China killed more than 700 people and caused retail sales to fall by almost half. But despite the fact that the new virus is considered less dangerous, it can now spread much faster than at the beginning of the century. The reason for this is the infrastructure of China, which has become much more developed during this time. Oil prices were the first to react to the new attack, but the foreign exchange market was not long in reacting.\nAs for Ms. Lagarde, she really disappointed investors, saying that the revision of the ECB's strategy is a long process that will only be completed by the end of 2020. Moreover, against the background of the US President Trump's warnings about the possible introduction of increased duties on European exports, Ms. Lagarde considered that \the risks for the euro zone are still skewed towards the decline of the economy.\ And so the European regulator will have to maintain an ultra-soft approach to its monetary policy.\nAgainst the background of such statements by the head of the ECB and the Chinese epidemic, even favorable data on business activity in Germany (PMI) did not help the euro, and the EURUSD pair fell to the level of 1.1020 by the end of the week. Last week, 40% of experts and the absolute majority of indicators warned that it would attack the 1.1000 level. Among the oscillators on H4 there are 75% of them, on D1 – 65%, among the trend indicators, 100% on H4 and 90% on D1 point to the south.\n\n - GBPUSD. Thanks to the growth of business activity (PMI) on Friday, January 24, the British currency reached a two-week high at 1.3172, but then went down again. Expectations of an interest rate cut at the Bank of England meeting on January 30, as well as the same notorious Chinese coronavirus, contributed to the fall.\nThe dynamics of the movement of the GBPUSD pair was most accurately predicted last week by graphical analysis. As for the final chord, the pair ended the trading session at 1.3080, slightly correcting the mid-term Pivot Point zone in the upward direction - to the range of 1.3050-1.3085;\n\n- USDJPY. According to some experts, the extremely low volatility of the EURUSD pair indicates that a certain balance has been established between these two major currencies. And now the euro and the dollar are in the balance on the one hand, and emerging market currencies and stocks on the other. And these markets, especially those of neighboring countries, may be particularly affected by the crisis caused by the spread of the Chinese coronavirus.\nAs it turned out, the yen gained the most from such anxious but vague expectations, being a safe haven that can shelter investors' capital from unpredictable financial storms. A third of the experts who voted for the fall of the pair, and even more so the oscillators that gave signals about its overbought, could not know about the coronavirus pandemic, but, nevertheless, gave the correct forecast. The pair quickly turned the support of 109.65-109.70 into resistance, and then found a local bottom at the level of 109.17. As for the end of the trading session, it finished it very close, at the level of 109.27;\n\n– cryptocurrencies. If someone dreamed of cryptocurrencies as an independent and free from state control financial system, they could forget about it. Just one example. The Minister of Finance of Ukraine announced that the state financial monitoring service will investigate where the citizens of this country got the cryptocurrency from. According to the Minister, the tools available to this organization allow them to determine both the origin of digital assets and what they were spent on. Moreover, this service has the authority to block cryptocurrencies and seize assets illegally obtained by Ukrainian citizens.\nIt is clear that this news did not contribute to the fall of Bitcoin, but the fact remains that the reference cryptocurrency could not gain a foothold above $9,000 and on Friday, January 24, it fell to the $8,250-8,450 zone.\nAccording to some experts, what is to blame for this fall... is the Chinese New Year. Comparing the results of trading in this period over the past few years, they noted that the risk of a drawdown of the main coin is present even against the background of the overall growth dynamics. According to their calculations, in Asia, about 10 percent of residents have savings in cryptocurrency. And before the New Year, they start cashing in assets and spending money on gifts and holiday parties.\nAltcoins: Ethereum (ETHUSD), Litecoin (LTCUSD) and Ripple (XRPUSD), as usual, followed in the wake of the main cryptocurrency. The total capitalization of the crypto market decreased from $251 to $236 billion.\n\n\nAs for the forecast for the coming week, summarizing the opinions of a number of experts, as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis, we can say the following:\n\n- EURUSD. As already mentioned, for the ECB, a weak euro is now preferable to a strong one. Realizing this, the bulls do not want to take risks, which makes the European currency even weaker. Its nearest target in the downtrend is 1.1000, followed by 1.0960. This is followed by the low of October 01, 2019 -1.0880. 55% of analysts now vote for the fall, supported by 85% of oscillators and 100% of trend indicators not only on H4 and D1, but also on W1.\nThe opposite view is expressed by 45% of experts and 15% of oscillators in the oversold zone. Moreover, when switching from a weekly forecast to a monthly one, the number of bull supporters increases to 70%. The immediate task is to overcome the strong resistance in the 1.1065 zone, followed by the 1.1100 and 1.1175 resistances.\nAs for the Fed's decision on the interest rate on January 29, it is likely that it will remain at the same level – 1.75%, and this meeting will not have much impact on the dynamics of the pair;\n\n- GBPUSD. Done! Here it is, the X day, Friday 31 January, which will be followed by the UK's farewell to the European Union. Brexit, which everyone has been talking about for so long, can be considered accomplished. However, we think that at the moment this event will put more moral pressure on the market – the relatively smooth process of the country's exit from the EU significantly reduces investment risks. Moreover, the current low rate of the pound helps the British economy in many ways, strengthening its competitiveness in foreign markets.\nIf there are no unexpected unpleasant surprises from Brexit, the pound may feel relatively calm. And it is not excluded that it will grow not only against the euro, but also against the dollar. So, 65% of experts expect it to move north - first to the resistance of 1.3160, and then to the height of 1.3200.\nAn alternative forecast is given by 35% of experts, according to whom the GBPUSD pair is expected to fall further. This scenario is especially likely if the Bank of England meeting on Thursday, January 30, gives at least a hint of a possible interest rate cut. In this case, the British currency has every chance to continue its journey to the south, in which, after breaking through the supports of 1.3040, 1.3000 and 1.2960, it can reach the lows of last December in the 1.2900 zone. Graphic analysis on D1 actively supports this development;\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n- USDJPY. There is some confusion among the indicators, but 10% of the oscillators are already giving clear signals that this pair is oversold. 60% of analysts supported by graphical analysis on D1 believe that it will stop falling as well. The goal is to rise to the zone 110.20-110.30. The next resistance is at 110.80;\nThe remaining 40% of experts side with the bears, who believe that the downward trend of the past week will continue. The Dow Jones index is aiming for 30.000, and the USDJPY pair should break through the 109 mark, which will lead to further losses for all cross-pairs related to the Japanese currency. The main support is at 108.40, the next one is 60 points lower;\n\n– cryptocurrencies. Along with the fall of the main cryptocurrency, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index also fell slightly down, from 54 to 40. This is not yet a fear of the market, but investors are no longer particularly attracted to opening long positions.\nEven some of the crypto prophets have tempered their appetites. In a recent tweet, trader and crypto analyst Josh Rager expressed the opinion that, as in other markets, Bitcoin has a \law of decreasing the rate of return\, and there is a decrease in its profitability in each cycle. \The next Bitcoin maximum will not be as high as most people think. Some point to $100,000, $300,000, and $1 million. One should also take into account the decrease in the profit margin by about 20% in each cycle. Therefore, I think the next high will be in the range of $75,000 to $85,000,\ the analyst wrote. Rager's position on this issue was also supported by the cryptocurrency analytical company ByteTree.\nIf we talk about forecasts for the near future, they are not so optimistic. 50% of experts expect the BTCUSD pair to fall to the $7,500-8,000 zone, 30% voted for a sideways trend and only 20%¬ - for the pair to rise above the $9,000 horizon. However, when switching to the monthly forecast, the number of crypto optimists increases to 70%.\n\n\nRoman Butko, NordFX\n\n\nNotice: These materials should not be deemed a recommendation for investment or guidance for working on financial markets: they are for informative purposes only.

  content : Forex and Cryptocurrency Forecast for February 17 - 21, 2020\n\n \nFirst, a review of last week’s events:\n  \n- EURUSD. Stop-loss orders on long positions for this pair are triggered one after another for the second week in a row. The bulls retreat, successively surrendering all their lines of defense. The pair has not just updated the lows of this and last years, it has reached the lowest values since May 2017. And the most interesting thing is that there is no one serious reason for such a collapse of the European currency. You can explain the collapse of the USDCHF pair on \Black Thursday\ in January 2015 or the fall of the pound following the referendum on the UK's exit from the EU. And here it seems that nothing extraordinary has happened.\nExperts call a variety of possible reasons that in total could lead to the fact that the dollar has pushed the euro by 270 points over the past two weeks, and, practically, without corrections. Among them are the difference in the positions of the ECB and the Fed regarding the policy of easing (QE) and the value of interest rates, as well as concerns about a prolonged recession in the euro zone, caused by the gloomy macroeconomic indicators of the German and EU economies. Coronavirus did not have the last word, because, unlike the US, the European economy is more vulnerable to Chinese risks. Traditionally, the dollar has been supported by a series of government bond offerings by the US Treasury.\nIt is difficult to say which of these factors the experts surveyed had been guided by, but the forecast given by most of them was absolutely accurate. Recall that 60% of experts supported by graphical analysis on H4, 100% of trend indicators and 85% of oscillators were confident that the pair would continue to fall. The goal was to test the November-October 2019 lows around 1.0880. The test was successful, and the pair ended the five-day session at 1.0835;\n\n - GBPUSD. The British currency seemed to set out to prove to the British that their country's exit from the EU was absolutely correct. While the former European \counterpart\ of the pound, the euro, was continuously falling, the British, on the contrary, was growing all the past week, adding almost 200 points and reaching at maximum the height of 1.3070.\nInitially, after the unexpected resignation of Chancellor Sajid Javid, who disagreed with the personnel policy of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the pound went down, but very quickly it turned around after Rishi Sunak became the new Head of the UK Finance Ministry - an experienced financier and, concurrently, the son-in-law of a billionaire. Tax cuts and increased budget spending, of which Sunak is an apologist, can seriously fuel interest in the British currency.\nThe forecast given last week believed that in the event of an upward trend reversal, the pound would overcome the resistance of 1.2975 and possibly break through the upper limit of the 1.2800-1.3000 channel. This is what happened: the pair set the final chord at 1.3045;\n\n- USDJPY. It seems that the bulls can't take the 110.00 level. Not yet. The pair tried to gain a foothold above it in mid-January and tried again to do so in February. But again, to no avail. Even the strengthening of the dollar as a safe-haven currency did not help. Having barely reached the 110.13 mark in the middle of the week, the pair turned around and eventually finished at 109.77;   \n\n– cryptocurrencies. What is the best refuge from the economic turmoil caused by the coronavirus? Dollar? Yes, indeed, it shows convincing growth against the euro and a number of other currencies. But Bitcoin shows even more convincing growth against the dollar itself. Last week, 80% of analysts thought that the BTCUSD pair would reach $10.450. And this forecast was 99.99% correct: ¬ on Thursday, February 13, its quotes reached a height of $10.490. Thus, since the beginning of January, the cost of the main cryptocurrency has increased by more than 45%.\nSo, is Bitcoin the super safe haven?\nHowever, as it turned out, there are even more attractive assets. The demand for Bitcoin has also pushed the demand for such top altcoins as Ethereum (ETHUSD), Litecoin (LTCUSD), Ripple (XRPUSD), and others. And if before they followed in the wake of the reference cryptocurrency, now some of them have gone far ahead. For example, Ethereum has increased in price by 120% since the beginning of the year, but it has increased by 35% only in the last week.\nThis activity of alternative coins could not but affect the share of Bitcoin in the total capitalization of the crypto market: if in early January it was 70%, today it has dropped to 62.4%. So the discussion about the best asset-haven is not over yet.\n\n\nAs for the forecast for the coming week, summarizing the opinions of a number of experts, as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis, we can say the following:\n\n- EURUSD. The calendar for the upcoming week is filled with information for fundamental analysis specialists. Although, as for the Eurozone, the forecasts do not promise anything good in advance. It is expected that the indicators of the indices that characterize the state of the business environment in Germany and the eurozone – ZEW on Tuesday, February 18 and Markit on February 21 – will be lower than the previous ones. The report on the ECB meeting on February 20 may add to the pessimism. All this can lead to further losses of the euro against the US dollar. Positive news from the front of the fight against coronavirus will be able to turn the trend up, but it is still difficult to predict anything here.\n100% of the trend indicators on H4 and D1 are colored red. 65% of oscillators look down as well. The targets are 1.0700 and 1.0525; However, the remaining 35% of the oscillators are already in the oversold zone, which is a very strong signal for a possible upward trend reversal. Or, at least, for a serious correction, which, according to the indications of the graphical analysis on H4, can return the pair to the 1.0900 zone, and, perhaps, bring it closer to the 1.1000 mark.\nAt the moment, only 40% of experts vote for the pair's growth, however, when switching to the monthly forecast, their number increases to 65%;\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n- GBPUSD. It is possible that in addition to the resignation of Chancellor Sajid Javid, the UK is able to present other surprises in these difficult times. As they say about Brexit, the farther into the forest, the thicker the trees.   For now, the picture looks like this. Trend indicators on H4 indicate: up 95%, down 5%, on D1 up 75%, down 25%. Oscillators: on H4, 90% is green, 10% is overbought, and on D1, it is a complete mess. Analysts do not have any clear point of view, although, when moving to the medium-term forecast, most of them (65%) side with the bulls. The nearest bullish target is 1.3200, the resistance levels are 1.3070, 1.3115 and 1.3160. Supports: 1.3000, 1.2970, 1.2940 and 1.2880;\n   \n- USDJPY. After the week-long sideways trend of this pair, there is complete discord among the indicators. As for experts, 70% of them, supported by graphical analysis on H4 and D1, look to the north. According to their scenario, the pair should eventually overcome the resistance of 110.00 and rise another 80-100 points higher. The remaining 30% of analysts remain pessimistic. In their opinion, the decline in the stock market and the yield of government bonds may lead to a fall in the pair to the zone of 109.10-109.30, following supports are 108.30 and 107.65.\n\n– cryptocurrencies. The forecasts of the crypto market gurus are, as usual, overflowing with enthusiasm. The Bitcoin exchange rate will rise to $40,000 within the year, said co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors Tom Lee in an interview with CNBC. He attributed the halving, the coronavirus outbreak, the geopolitical instability, and overcoming the 200-day moving average to the reasons for the cryptocurrency's rise in price. According to Lee, the White House deliberately interfered with the rally of the first cryptocurrency last year. But now the US government is distracted by the election of the new President and will not be able to organize a campaign against Bitcoin.\nAnthony Pompliano, partner of Morgan Creek Digital investment company, predicts further growth of the main cryptocurrency as well. He is confident that the explosive growth of the Bitcoin exchange rate will occur due to the growing demand for the asset and its limited issue, resulting in it reaching $100,000 by the end of 2021.\nIn general, 60% of analysts expect that the BTCUSD pair will break the $11,000 mark in February-March. However, while last week it was only 20% of experts who exclaimed: \Beware of a trend reversal!\, now their number has doubled, reaching 40%. Some crypto traders believe that the growth in the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which began in January, is caused by \ghost money\. As they say, on certain trading platforms, large orders appear periodically, which are not intended to buy or sell cryptocurrency, but to create the illusion of a demand for the asset. Someone provokes investors to purchase the coin with their help, thereby inflating its price. \You can only push the price so high with the help of \ghost money\. At some point, people will want to cash out their crazy earnings, but will not be able to find someone to sell the asset to. This is going to be a show!\- one of the crypto sceptics wrote on Twitter.\nAnd in this situation, the brokerage company NordFX offers probably the best option for trading cryptocurrencies – a kind of contract for the difference in price, without the actual delivery of coins. In this case, when opening long or short positions, you can be sure that even if the price of Bitcoin soars to the skies or, conversely, collapses to zero, you will get your due profit.\n\n\nRoman Butko, NordFX\n\n\nNotice: These materials should not be deemed a recommendation for investment or guidance for working on financial markets: they are for informative purposes only. Trading on financial markets is risky and can lead to a loss of money deposited.\n\neurusd gbpusd usdjpy usdchf forex forex_example signals forex cryptocurrencies bitcoin,

  content : Forex and Cryptocurrency Forecast for February 24 - 28, 2020\n\n \nFirst, a review of last week’s events:\n  \n- EURUSD. The dollar index has already gained 2.5% since the beginning of February, reaching the highest since May 2017. The euro continues to lose ground. Beginning on January 01, the advance of the dollar has weakened the European currency by 440 points. It has lost almost 300 points, or 2.7%, in the last three weeks of continuous decline alone.\nExperts have managed to put forward many reasons for what is going on during this time, most often referring to fears about the coronavirus. But even here, when they talk about the same thing, they manage to draw opposite conclusions. As a result, some attribute the dollar to safe-haven currencies, while others, on the contrary, consider it a rather risky asset that will bring losses to investors as soon as the peak of the epidemic is passed and the Chinese economy begins to recover. It is quite possible that this will start to take place in the near future, since the Chinese leadership is applying efforts not only to fight the epidemic, but also to stimulate production and ease the monetary policy. One of these measures was the reduction by the People's Bank of China of the interest rate on the yuan from 4.15% to 4.05% on Thursday, February 20.\nWe cannot but agree with those experts who believe that the catalyst for the fall of the EURUSD pair is the weakness of the European economy in the first place and ultra-low interest rates, which make the dollar much more attractive to investors. In addition, the truce in the trade war between the US and China also plays against the Euro.\nThe majority of analysts (60%) had voted for a further fall in the euro last week, supported by 100% of trend indicators and 65% of oscillators. At the same time, the remaining 35% had already been giving signals the European currency was oversold. If you look at the EURUSD quotes, they accurately reflect this distribution of forces. At first, the pair went down, and then, starting from the midweek, it moved into a sideways trend, turning the 1.0800 horizon into either support or resistance. The divergence with the readings of many oscillators, such as the MACD, gave long position holders hope for a trend reversal. However, this did not happen, the fall only stopped. And only at the very end of the five-day period, the pair made a sharp jump up, finishing at 1.0848 and thus zeroing out the total result of the week;\n \n- GBPUSD. The UK contributed to the weakening of the EU economy as well: after Brexit, the European Union budget has a deficit of €75 billion, and no one seems to know how to make up for such a serious loss. The British currency itself, unlike the euro, can be said to have stabilized against the dollar and, since the last decade of November 2019, has been moving along the 1.3000 line. The volatility is still quite high (220 points last week), but the pair repeatedly returns to this supportresistance zone.\nThe bears repeatedly tried to push the British defense in February, lowering the pound below the 1.3000 horizon. The pair even reached the local bottom at 1.2850 last week, but... then it turned around again, rushed up and finished the working week at 1.2960;\n  \n- USDJPY. Giving the forecast for the past week, the vast majority of experts (70%), supported by graphical analysis on H4 and D1, had turned their views to the north. And they turned out to be right: the pair not only broke the landmark level of 110.00, but even without noticing several levels of resistance, soared to the height of 112.20, reaching the highs of April 2019. The main reason is called a sharp drop in interest in the yen as a safe-haven currency, against the background of an improvement in the situation with the coronavirus and, as a result, a turn of the markets towards riskier assets. The actions of the Chinese authorities to support companies affected by the epidemic also played against the yen.\nAfter the pair took the height of 112.00, a correction occurred, and the final chord of the week sounded at the level of 111.60;\n\n– cryptocurrencies. Longhash company has analyzed in detail the data on buying and selling bitcoins over the past two years and has made interesting conclusions. So, the researchers have found that the lowest average price of Bitcoin is observed on Fridays at 6 am GMT. In fact, this means the best time to open long positions. At midnight united time (UTC) on Mondays and Tuesdays, the price of BTC is on average $170 higher than on Fridays. It turns out that Monday or Tuesday is the best time to exit the Friday long or enter a short position until the next Friday (when the price is lower according to statistics).\nAt the same time, analysts warn that the crypto market is very volatile, so it is unlikely that the results of such a study should be considered investment advice. \nAnd this is a very correct remark, especially if you look at the results of the past week. The price of Bitcoin was really low in the morning of Friday, February 14. And if a trader opened a long position at this point, he or she would have received a good profit by the end of the day. But if they left the position open until Monday, February 17, they would lose a tidy sum, since Bitcoin had fallen by about $600 during this time.\nThe main cryptocurrency has tried several times to gain a foothold above $10,000 over the past seven days, but to no success. The local bottom of the BTCUSD pair was fixed at $9.290, and among the reasons for this decline are, primarily, the tightening of pressure on Bitcoin by the US authorities, including President Trump, Fed chief Powell and Finance Minister Mnuchin.\nIt goes without saying that when going down, the main cryptocurrency pulled the top altcoins, including Ethereum (ETHUSD), Litecoin (LTCUSD) and Ripple (XRPUSD), and the Crypto Fear & Greed Index rolled back from the state of \greed\ to the state of \fear\.\n\n\nAs for the forecast for the coming week, summarizing the opinions of a number of experts, as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis, we can say the following:\n\n- EURUSD. Global markets are saturated with liquidity, including major currencies. It seems that Central banks know no other way to support the economy than to pump it with cheap money. The US Federal reserve spends $ 60 billion a month to buy bills, the ECB buys securities for 20 billion euros, and the Bank of Japan – for 80 trillion yen. Regulators in other countries are not far behind. And, at the moment when this money appears on the markets, we can observe fluctuations in prices in one direction or another.\nThe dollar today is a cross between a classic protective and a risky asset. This is due to political factors, the state of the US economy, and the actions of the Federal reserve, whose ability to reduce interest rates is far from exhausted, in contrast to its European and Japanese \counterparts\.\nAll this allows 70% of analysts to count on the continued growth of the US currency and its reduction at least to the zone of 1.0750. It should be noted that the survey was conducted before the pair's short-term rally to the north on Friday just before the markets closed. It is also important that when moving to the forecast for March, the same number – 70% – of experts expect the pair to return to the level of 1.1000.\nAs for the indicators, if the vast majority of them were painted red in the morning of Friday, February 21, the situation changed radically by the evening and 70% acquired a green color on H4. On D1, however, the advantage still remains with the the bears: 75% of trend indicators and oscillators still point to the south. Nearest supports are 1.0800 and 1.0775;\n\n- GBPUSD. The Pivot Point of the last three months can be considered the 1.3000 horizon, but starting from January 2020, there has been a certain increase in the bearish sentiment. That is why 55% of experts expect that the pair will once again test the previous week's low of 1.2850 and, if successful, will fall another 80-100 points lower. The remaining 45% of experts are expecting the pound to strengthen and the pair to rise to the 1.3000-1.3070 zone. The next target is 1.3120. \nThere is a complete discord among the indicators on D1 at the end of the week, but on H4, 60% of trend indicators and oscillators indicate the growth of the pair.\nThe compromise option is offered by graphical analysis on D1, which draws a decline at the end of February to the level of 1.2685, and then a return in the first decade of March, first to the level of 1.3000, and then to the height of 1.3200;\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n- USDJPY. It is clear that the vast majority of indicators look up. However, about 15% of oscillators are already sending signals about the pair being overbought. Graphical analysis on D1 shows that the pair will stay in the range 111.25-112.00 for some time at the beginning of the week, after which it will go up to the zone 112.40-112.70.\nAs for experts, 75% believe that the pair will definitely return to the 109.65-110.25 zone, although this may take two to three weeks. The remaining 25% of analysts are expecting the pair to rise above the 112.40 mark, the target is 113.70;\n\n– cryptocurrencies. The founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz, is convinced that Bitcoin will be firmly fixed at the historical high of $20,000 by the end of 2020. According to the expert, Bitcoin is unstable right now, but it will definitely break the historical high of $20,000 by the end of the year, or at least reach it. This could happen sooner, in a couple of months, thanks to the halving. The emergence of regulated crypto exchanges and the adoption of the asset by conservative institutional investors will also serve as a positive factor for the growth of the first cryptocurrency. In addition, the continued issue of fiat currencies can also play into the hands of Bitcoin. \The main digital asset, just like gold, acts as a hedge asset, protecting investors from inflation and state monetary policy, leading to the depreciation of money,\ Novograts explained.\nAn even happier future for Bitcoin is predicted by well-known Bitcoin enthusiast TV host Max Kaiser. He raised his forecast for the price of this cryptocurrency to $400,000 per coin, increasing it by four times at once. Participating in the Infowars news show, Kaiser said that his previous prediction in 2012 of $100,000 is now too conservative. \nIn general, 70% of experts remain optimistic, expecting to see Bitcoin in the $10,500-11,000 zone within the next few weeks. The remaining 30% of experts call the level of $8,000 as the lower bar for the fall of the BTCUSD pair.\n\n\nRoman Butko, NordFX\n\n\nNotice: These materials should not be deemed a recommendation for investment or guidance for working on financial markets: they are for informative purposes only.

  content : Forex Forecast and Cryptocurrencies Forecast for March 09 - 13, 2020\n\n \nFirst, a review of last week’s events:\n  \n- EURUSD. It seems that now one can ignore the macroeconomic indicators, which previously not only had an impact on the quotes, but also could reverse trends by 180 degrees. The situation in the financial markets has been completely dominated by the coronavirus for many weeks on the run, which now affects not only the health of people, but also the actions of governments and Central banks. \nGlobal regulators are massively lowering interest rates. The effect of a bombshell was produced by the decision of the US Federal reserve, taken at an emergency meeting convened for the first time since the 2008 crisis, to lower the key interest rate from 1.75% up to 1.25%. This decision was the outcome of a teleconference with the participation of Finance Ministers and Central bankers of the G7 States on monetary policy in the face of the coronavirus Covid-19.\nCome from war, you belong to war, and a lull on the fronts of the fight against this infection is not yet expected. The amplitude of fluctuations of the basic currency pairs breaks all the trading strategies created in a quiet and calm 2019. The DXY dollar index lost 1.7% over the past week, while it had been not far from 3-year highs just two weeks before.\nStarting from January 01 to February 20, 2020, the dollar rose against the euro by 460 points, which is an impressive figure in itself. But onwards and upwards: having made a U-turn, the EURUSD pair has soared by more than 640 points in just the last two weeks! And all these jumps, both up and down, took place without any serious corrections, knocking out first the bulls, and now the bears. The height of only one daily \candle\ on Friday, March 06, was more than 140 points.\nIt should be noted that in general, the forecast given last week by the majority of our experts (60%) and supported by 70% of the indicators was correct. The new year's high at 1.1240 was named as the goal the pair was supposed to reach. However, on the last day of the trading session, against the background of an 18% collapse in the yield of 10-year us bonds, the pair did overcome this resistance, reaching a peak of 1.1355, and it ended the five-day period at 1.1300;\n\n- GBPUSD. Surprisingly, the fact is: no matter what happens in the world in general, and in the UK in particular, the GBPUSD pair repeatedly returns to the iconic supportresistance zone of 1.3000 for the fifth month in a row. This was also the case last week: after finding the local bottom at 1.2735, the pair flew up almost 300 points and finished at 1.3030. This fully confirmed the forecast given by the majority (65%) of experts who predicted the pair's return to the 1.3000-1.3070 zone;\n\n- USDJPY. The flight from the dollar and the growing demand for hedging currencies allowed the yen to demonstrate a phenomenal two-week growth of 720 points, i.e. by 6.4%. However, analysts' forecasts were even bolder. They expected that, supported by the coronavirus, the pair will break through the support of 107.50, 106.65, 105.65 one after another and approach the August 2019 low in the area of 104.45. The supports were broken indeed, however, the pair failed to achieve its goal: the local low was recorded on Friday, March 06 at 104.98, and the final chord sounded at 105.35; \n\n– cryptocurrencies. We doubted in the last review that Bitcoin has actually become the same hedge asset as the euro or, even more so, the yen, as many crypto gurus have tried to prove to everyone. As it turns out, we are not alone in our doubts. Billionaire, former Wall Street banker and Bitcoin enthusiast Michael Novogratz was surprised to find that Bitcoin quotes were rolling down at the same time as the dollar and stock indices in the last decade of February. \How did BTC stop being an asset for hedging risks and start trading as high-risk securities?  Novogratz exclaimed on Twitter. \It hurts!\\. In his opinion, those traders who lost on the stock market started shorting Bitcoin in an attempt to catch up, and eventually drove the quotes down.\nIn fairness, it should be noted that the reference cryptocurrency has tried to restore its reputation last week. However, it failed: having lost more than $2,000 in price over the previous two weeks, it only won $730 back. This success against the background of the explosive growth of the euro and the yen looks quite modest. So it's probably too early to talk about Bitcoin as a truly protective asset.\nAs for such top altcoins as Ethereum (ETHUSD), Litecoin (LTCUSD) and Ripple (XRPUSD), they have traditionally followed in the wake of the BTCUSD pair. The capitalization of the crypto market in the past week has remained almost unchanged: at the level of $256 billion, the Bitcoin Crypto Fear & Greed Index has also almost frozen in place: the drop from 40 to 39 points is simply not worth taking into account.\n\n\nAs for the forecast for the coming week, summarizing the opinions of a number of experts, as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis, we can say the following:\n\n- EURUSD. 100% of the trend indicators on H4 and D1 are colored green. But 25% of the oscillators on D1 indicate that the pair is overbought, which can be a strong signal for a downtrend reversal or a serious correction. Graphical analysis on H4 looks down as well. (Although, one must say, coronavirus hardly pays attention to divergence and RSI, Stochastic or MACD readings).\nAs for fundamental analysis, at the moment the situation looks ambiguous. On the one hand, the probability of another rate cut at the next meeting of the US Federal Reserve on March 18 is close to 100%. Moreover, this reduction may become the next stage of the cycle, as a result of which the rate will be at the level of 0.5% or even lower at the end of the second quarter – President Donald Trump calls for lowering the rate to 0%, providing additional liquidity to private banks and easing monetary policy as much as possible.\nFalling interest rates play against the dollar. And then, once again, the yield on 10-year US bonds may fall. But, on the other hand, the situation in Europe is even worse. First, the Eurozone economy is much more strongly correlated with the Chinese economy. And secondly, if the Fed still has room for maneuver and further rate cuts, the ECB has almost no such space. The deposit rate for commercial banks in euros is already in the red and is -0.5%.   \nA representative of the ECB admitted the possibility of further reduction of already negative interest rates last week. However, whether the European mega-regulator will decide to take such a step may become clear after its meeting on Thursday, March 12. \nAs for analysts' forecasts, according to most of them, as the situation with the coronavirus resolves, the situation on the financial markets will stabilize, and the EURUSD pair will return to the range of 1.1000-1.1100. 60% of experts voted for this result in the weekly perspective, 70% in the monthly perspective, and 80% in the medium – term perspective. The nearest strong supports are 1.1240 and 1.1175. \n40% of analysts have voted that the dollar will continue to fall in the coming week and the pair will reach the 1.1450-1.1500 zone;\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n- GBPUSD. The pair has once again returned to the medium-term Pivot Point 1.3000 zone. Graphical analysis on H4 predicts the pair's movement in the side channel 1.2860-1.3070 for the next few days, while on D1 the range of weekly fluctuations is naturally wider:1.2760-1.3170. But in both cases, the pair eventually returns to the 1.3000 horizon.\n95% of the trend indicators and 75% of the oscillators on both timeframes look north, but 25% of the oscillators are already in the overbought zone.\nAs for the experts' forecast for the next week, it is impossible to give someone an advantage – a third of them have voted for the pair's growth, a third for its fall, and a third for a sideways movement. However, when moving to the forecast for the month, the scales are tilted towards the British currency¬ – 60% of analysts believe that the pair will be able to reach the 1.1400-1.1500 zone by the end of March;  \n\n- USDJPY. It has been repeatedly stated that market fears of the Covid-19 epidemic force investors to redirect cash flows towards protective assets. And here one should pay attention to the dynamics of the Fear Index VIX, which is one of the measures of expectation of stock market volatility. It is generally accepted that if the VIX has reached the 40% mark and continues to grow, the stock exchange has started to panic. So, over the past half-month, this index has grown from 15% to almost 47%. If you add a drop in the dollar to the collapse of US government bonds, it becomes clear that in such a situation, the yen is a big winner. \Country of the rising yen\ – that is how many investors now call Japan.\nMarket fears are also reflected in the readings of technical analysis tools. 100% of trend indicators and 85% of oscillators are now colored red.\nThe remaining 15% of the oscillators give signals that the pair is oversold. Following them, the majority of experts, supported by graphical analysis, expects the turn of the pair up. It is clear that the trend change to an uptrend is directly related to the success of the fight against Covid-19. Therefore, the forecasts for the coming week are very cautious: only 55% of analysts have voted for the pair's growth here. But the medium-term forecast looks much more optimistic for the dollar: its growth relative to the yen is expected by 80% of experts. The nearest resistance is 107.70, the goal is to return to the 108.25-109.65 echelon.\nThe support zone is 104.45-105.00. It was at the peak of the aggravation of trade risks that the price rested not only in 2019, but also in 2018. And if the pair manages to break through this support, the path for it will be open to the lows of 2016 in the area of 99.00-101.00;  \n\n– cryptocurrencies. It should be noted that in general, the news background is favorable for Bitcoin. For example, the German Federal Office for Financial Supervision (BaFin) has for the first time recognized the main cryptocurrency as a financial instrument.  And the largest insurance operator Lloyd's of London, together with the start-up Coincover, presented a new solution for insuring cryptocurrencies in hot wallets. According to them, since the beginning of the year, the digital market has started to \warm up\, so we should expect a \new wave\ of traders and investors.

  content : Forex Forecast and Cryptocurrencies Forecast for March 16 - 20, 2020\n\n \nFirst, a review of last week’s events:\n  \n- EURUSD. That's it! The world economy is no longer run by governments, banks, or corporations. The economy is reigned by only one \person\ named Covid-19. The coronavirus pandemic has caused panic on the stock exchanges, a collapse in oil prices, a drop in production, and border closures. Humanity is scared, not knowing what to expect after a week, a month, six months. Schools and universities, restaurants and cafes, parks and stadiums are empty, and people are advised not to go out on the streets at all. Food and toilet paper are disappearing from supermarkets. All sorts of mass events are canceled, and a joke is circulating on social networks that the conference on the fight against the coronavirus was canceled because of...the coronavirus. President Trump's decision to close the US borders and ban the entry of Europeans sent markets into shock. EuroSTOXX50 futures fell 5.57%, while DAX30 futures fell 4.22%. US stock indexes suffered the biggest losses in the past 33 years. The main indexes of Japan, Australia, India, Hong Kong, South Korea, and other countries reached multi-year lows.\nRecall that on March 04, the effect of an exploding bomb was produced by the decision taken at the emergency meeting of the US Federal Reserve to lower the key interest rate from 1.75% to 1.25%. Against this background, the EURUSD pair soared by more than 640 points, coming close to the 1.1500 mark.\nUnlike its American counterparts, the ECB left the rate unchanged at its meeting on Thursday, March 12. Bank Governor Christine Lagarde said the Eurozone banking system is stable and does not require a rate cut. (It is already negative and is -0.5%). But the market was much more impressed by Ms Lagarde's words that the ECB should not solve the problem of narrow spreads. Investors remembered the debt crisis triggered by rate hike in 2011, and both European stocks and the European currency immediately flew down, finding a bottom only on the horizon of 1.1055.\nIf last year the weekly range of fluctuations of the pair was barely approaching 200 points, this year EURUSD easily overcomes this value in just a few hours. Last week, at the maximum, the dollar won back about 440 points from the euro. Then a correction followed, and the pair ended the five-day period near the 1.1100 level. This result, in our opinion, indicates that the markets are completely confused, as the pair once again returned to the Pivot Point zone, along which it has been moving since May 2019.\nAs for the forecast given a week ago, 40% of analysts voted that the pair would reach the 1.1450-1.1500 zone then. And it did it on Monday, March 09. The majority of experts (60%) voted for the pair's return to the range of 1.1000-1.1100, where, as mentioned above, it eventually returned. So, both were 100% right. is it a paradox? No, the coronavirus just decided that;\n\n- GBPUSD. There are two main factors weighing on the pound. The first is the confusion in the oil market and the fall in prices for this energy carrier, which is closely correlated with the British currency. The second is the negative dynamics of the debt market. The yield on 10-year government bonds in the UK continues to decline in comparison with similar securities in the US and Germany. But if the bond yield just falls, the pound quotes are carried like an avalanche into the abyss. What else can you call a 900-point drop in just 5 days?\nAs a result, the pair reached the values of the first decade of October 2019 and ended the trading session where a week ago the bulls could not even imagine in their nightmares: at 1.2280;\n\n- USDJPY. The dollar has been rising since Monday evening, March 09, against the euro, the pound, and the yen. Investors are also getting rid of gold, with which the pair has an inverse correlation. As a result, having pushed off from the support of 101.17on Monday, on Friday, March 13, the pair was in the same place where it was on Friday, March 06 – at the level of 108.00. There is nothing strange in such a figure in terms of graphical analysis. The only striking thing is the timing and scope of fluctuations: – first 700 points down in 5.5 days, then the same amount up in 4.5 days. What can you do about it, this is now the new reality; \n\n– cryptocurrencies. \Cui prodest?”, - said the ancient Romans, which means: \Look for who benefits.\ And it was the benefit for all crypto-gurus, crypto-millionaires and other owners of large volumes of cryptocurrencies. After all, it was they who had been convincing investors and traders that bitcoin, and with it the rest of the crypto market, will again soar to unprecedented heights in the near future. \Bitcoin has become a great tool for hedging currency risks and will soon replace the dollar!\- they had been shouting, urging everyone to invest in crypto-coins, thereby making them richer and richer. So what?\nTalking about the spells of these \priests\, we constantly warned that before investing money, it is necessary to correctly assess the situation, and, perhaps, instead of buy, open a position on sell – as the BTCUSD pair can not only grow rapidly, but also fall even more rapidly. Which is what happened last week.\nIf you believe the apologists of bitcoin, it was conceived as a lifeline at the time of the stock market collapse, falling exchange rates and the destruction of economic ties. We are seeing all these misfortunes at the moment, but instead of dragging investors up, getting more expensive against the dollar, Bitcoin is sinking them even faster.  \nIn just one month from February 12 to March 13, the main cryptocurrency lost 58% in price, dropping from $10,340 to $4,300. On some exchanges, the drop was even greater – up to $3,815 and reached 63%.\nBitcoin lost up to half of its value in just one day from March 12 to 13, dragging the entire crypto market down with it, including such top altcoins as Ethereum (ETHUSD), litecoin (LTCUSD) and Ripple (XRPUSD). The situation had somewhat stabilized by the evening of Friday, March 13, and the BTCUSD pair rose to the level of $5,600. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is only 10 points out of 100 possible, which means that the market is not just afraid, but terrified.\n\n\nAs for the forecast for the coming week, summarizing the opinions of a number of experts, as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis, we can say the following:\n\n- EURUSD. The struggle of governments and regulators for the economies of their countries continues. The ECB did not cut interest rates but announced a 60% increase in the quantitative easing (QE) program, which will amount to €120 billion in 2019. For its part, the US Federal reserve is flooding the market with cheap money, under pressure from President Trump who is eager to be re-elected for the second term. The US has launched a short-term lending program since last week, under which the Fed is ready to lend $1.42 trillion to banks every week. This has never happened in the history of the United States. This week, banks have already received the first tranche at 0.255% per annum. This suggests that, with a high probability, the rate on the dollar will be reduced by at least 0.50% at the Fed meeting next week.\nThis balance of power is not in favor of the dollar. However, a small margin (55%) is still on the side of bears among the experts, they are supported by 85% of oscillators and trend indicators on H4. The remaining 45% of analysts believe that the dollar will still lose its position, and the pair will again go north. This is agreed by 15% of oscillators on H4, which give signals about the pair being oversold.\nGraphical analysis on H4 shows a sharp decline in the pair to the level of 1.0950, and then its growth first to the height of 1.1100, and then 100 points higher.\nHowever, with the ongoing coronavirus panic, super-turbulence in the stock and currency markets, and surging oil prices, any forecasts can turn to dust in a second. And this is proved by the chaos that reigns in the indicator readings on D1, where the green, red and gray colors are mixed.\nThe main support zones are 1.1065, 1.1000, 1.0850 and the February low 1.0750. The resistance zones – 1.1175, 1.1240, 1.1350 and 1.1500; \n\n- GBPUSD. It is clear that 100% of the trend indicators at the end of the weekly session are looking down. However, the situation is somewhat different among oscillators – 20% of them on the H4 timeframe and 15% on D1 are already in the oversold zone, which indicates an imminent correction or reversal of the trend up. Graphical analysis on D1 supports this development as well. According to its readings, the pair can reach the bottom near the October 2019 low of 1.2200, and then turn around and go north – first to the resistance of 1.2425, and then to the height of 1.2565. At the same time, given the range of fluctuations in recent weeks, it makes sense to designate two more support levels – 1.2065 and 1.1960, and two resistance levels – 1.2725 and 1.2870. Although, perhaps, this is not the limit.\nAs for the opinions of experts, it was not possible to form one for the upcoming week. But in the forecast for the next 1-2 months, the number of supporters of the pair's growth is a clear majority-75%, the goal is to rise to the level of 1.2900-1.3100;\n \n- USDJPY. If in the medium-term forecast for GBPUSD, most analysts voted for the growth of the pound and the fall of the dollar, the situation is the opposite with respect to the yen. Here, 60-70% of experts believe that in the next 1-2 months, the Japanese currency will lose its position, the pair will pass through the 108.30-109.75 zone like a knife through butter and reach the 112.00-112.40 level. The next target for the bulls is 200 points higher.\nNote that in the coming week, in addition to the US Federal Reserve's decision on the interest rate, we are waiting for similar decisions by the Bank of Japan on Thursday March 19 and the People's Bank of China on Friday March 20. Both of these regulators announced their intention to support commercial banks and companies in their countries. And if fluctuations in yuan rates do not surprise the market, a reduction in the yen rate will be a big surprise for investors.\nIf, when the dollar rate is lowered, the yen rate remains at the same negative level of -0.1%, it is possible that the scales will tilt in favor of the Japanese currency, and the USDJPY pair will go down again, breaking through the supports of 105.90, 104.50 and 103.15 one after another. The bears' goal is to return to last week's low and try to test the 101.00 level.\nAnd, of course, it will be necessary to closely monitor the current yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds and oil prices, which largely determine the Japanese yen quotes;\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n– cryptocurrencies. \What was that?\- many traders and investors ask themselves, looking back at the events of the past week. Was it the beginning of the end? Or a game of big speculators, after which Bitcoin will more than recoup all losses? Or, perhaps, people just did not fully believe in a bright crypto future, and in a critical situation related to the coronavirus, they simply preferred to get rid of virtual wealth, exchanging it for time-tested, quite tangible dollars.\nThe forecasts of the surveyed experts at the moment look rather timid and modest. According to 65% of them, the BTCUSD pair can reach the $6,000-6,500 zone next week. The remaining 45% can see it around $5,000.\nBut further on the situation for the bulls looks somewhat worse. Only 20% of experts believe that Bitcoin will be able to confidently gain a foothold above $7,000 by the end of March, and another 20% predict the coin will fall to the $3,000-3,500 zone. The remaining 60% are in no hurry to give any forecasts at all.\n\n\nNordFX Analytical Group\n\n\nNotice: These materials should not be deemed a recommendation for investment or guidance for working on financial markets: they are for informative purposes only.

Which means dollar can get even more cheaper, and the local currencies will gain in price thanks to that. So, small countries will halt dollar markets with pleasure.

  content : Encryption Standards Threatened Under Pretext of Battling Coronavirus\nnews.bitcoin.com\nby Kai Sedgwick\nMarch 21st, 2020\n\nExcerpt:\n\nGovernments around the world have been trying for some time to bypass encryption and backdoor messaging apps. End-to-end encryption was preventing authorities from stopping terrorist attacks, we were told, and personal privacy had to be sacrificed for the greater good. Now, as the coronavirus spreads through the world, the powers-that-be claim public health is being jeopardized by the oversharing of false or misleading information pertaining to the pandemic. The encryption battle is warming up.\n\n...\n\nRead entire article: https:news.bitcoin.comencryption-standards-threatened-under-pretext-of-battling-coronavirus\n\nAbout the author: https:news.bitcoin.comauthorkaisedgwick,

  content : Hi, everybody!  \n \nIn this complicated time, analysts expect the cryptocurrency market to benefit from the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak.\nSo they suggest it’s a good time to invest in different cryptocurrencies.\n \nWe have a blog article, where you can about bitcoin and other cryptos to buy in 2020.\n \nHere’s a brief overview:\n \n1. BITCOIN  \n \nBitcoin has greater liquidity than other cryptos with users able to convert coins to fiat and\nvice versa easily and without chipping off a chunk of their value during exchanges. \nExperts predict the coin to rise to $23,500 by the end of the year. \n \n2. ETHERUM \n \nEthereum is currently the world’s leading programmable blockchain.\nThis rise in price is influenced by current real-world crises. \n \nMany users believe that the launch of ETH 2.0 in July will spark another rise for ETH in 2020.\nPredictions for 2020 claims that ETH will rise to $11,375 by the end of the year. \n \n3. RIPPLE \n \nRipple aims to create a decentralized network of banks to facilitate transactions in a matter\nof minutes with lower fees anywhere in the world. \n \nNew changes on Ripple by developers could also improve XRP in the coming year,\nallowing Ripple to process up to 50,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest crypto around. \n \n4. LITECOIN \n \nCompared to other cryptos out there, litecoin is much more cost-effective.\nIt can also process transactions in only a fraction of Bitcoin’s 10-minute processing time. \n \nLitecoin is doing well in the market and many users are predicting its prices to continually\nrise as a result of the halving process. \n \n5. CARDANO \n \nExperts consider Cardano as a third-generation blockchain.\nIt is built-in with many features that make it secure, flexible and scalable for innovation more so than any other crypto. \n \nWith a market cap of $18.8 billion, Cardano stands as the 5th most valuable crypto in the market today. \n \n6. EOSIO \n \nWith a model called ‘Delegated Proof of Stake’ (DPoS), it aims to process millions of transactions\nin just a few seconds, potentially making it the fastest crypto in the market! \n \nEOSIO’s promising future has attracted a loyal audience since 2017,\nmaking its token EOS one of the most valuable coins in 2020. \n \nYou can read the full article on our blog.\n \nAs always waiting for your thoughts and comments. \nThanks, guys\n\nCheers,\nKarl\nBitcasino,

  content : Kesan Coronavirus kepada ekonomi Malaysia akibat penularan wabak virus corona Covid-19 yang memberi impak besar kepada manusia dan ekonomi seluruh dunia.\n\nCoronavirus atau Covid-19 adalah penyakit baru disebabkan oleh wabak virus corona yang boleh menjejaskan paru-paru dan saluran pernafasan yang teruk dan boleh membawa kematian kepada manusia seluruh dunia. Coronavirus novel 2019 (2019-nCoV) adalah virus baru ditemui pada 31 Disember 2019 di Wuhan, China yang menyebabkan penyakit pernafasan pada orang dan boleh menyebar dengan mudah dan cepat dari manusia ke manusia dan belum ditemui vaksin untuk melindungi daripada 2019-nCoV.\nVirus Corona telah menular dengan cepat dan telah menyebar ke wilayah lain di Cina dan ke seluruh dunia, termasuk negara Malaysia. Kerajaan Malaysia telah mengumumkan Perintah Kawalan Pergerakan pada 18 Mac sehingga 31 Mac 2020 akibat penularan wabak COVID-19 di Malaysia bagi mencegah penularan virus Corona di malaysia. Apa kesan Covid-19 kepada ekonomi global, kesan covid-19 kepada ekonomi malaysia dan kesan coronavirus terhadap harga emas ?\n\nIMPAK COVID-19 KEPADA EKONOMI GLOBAL\nImpak coronavirus “ketakutan seluruh dunia” yang memberi kesan ke atas segala-galanya daripada aktiviti perniagaan, pasaran saham, industri hingga ke perjalanan. Impak virus coronavirus pada ekonomi global adalah sangat ketara kepada pasaran di seluruh dunia terutama apabila melibatkan kuasa besar ekonomi iaitu China dan Amerika.\n\n\n \nChina adalah ekonomi kedua terbesar dunia melalui KDNK dan tulang belakang pembuatan global. China adalah negara terpantas yang pernah mencapai tempat kedua dengan AS kekal sebagai pendahulu. Terdapat banyak syarikat, merentas pelbagai industri di seluruh dunia yang bergantung kepada pengeluaran Cina untuk terus beroperasi. Oleh itu, coronavirus mempunyai kesan mendalam terhadap ekonomi global.\nCoronavirus telah menyebabkan ketidaktentuan ekonomi Cina dan seterusnya ekonomi global apabila kini seluruh dunia terkena wabak covid-19 yang menyebabkan semua pasaran dunia, saham, minyak dan sebagainya telah jatuh merudum. Banyak syarikat antarabangsa mempunyai kemudahan pengeluaran di China, termasuk jenama fesyen seperti Nike, Adidas, GAP dan Abercrombie & Fitch, syarikat gergasi telekomunikasi seperti AT&T, syarikat teknologi seperti Apple dan banyak lagi.\nCoronavirus telah memberi kesan kepada ekonomi global yang jatuh merudum apabila semua sektor terkesan seperti sektor teknologi dan tenaga. Harga minyak dunia jatuh 30% iaitu kejatuhan terbesar sejak Perang Teluk pertama pada tahun 1991 kekurangan permintaan apabila pengangkutan,pelancongan dan penerbangan berkurangan. Sektor hotel dan pelancongan berkurangan disebabkan oleh kuarantin dan kekurangan pelancong. Pusat beli-belah dan perniagaan yang berpaksikan pasaran China mengalami penurunan apabila  kekurangan pelanggan. Rizab Persekutuan AS menurunkan kadar faedah dalam usaha luar biasa untuk merangkumi kejatuhan ekonomi akibat coronavirus. Dalam langkah kecemasan pertama mereka sejak krisis kewangan 2008, mereka menurunkan kadar faedah mereka sebanyak setengah mata. Potongan dramatik dalam kadar faedah AS gagal memberi kesan yang dikehendaki. Sektor perkilangan dan pelancongan kurang memuaskan menambah jurang pasaran saham dan menyebabkan pasaran saham jatuh.\nWabak Corona telah memberi impak perjalanan dan penerbangan ke dan dari China atau seluruh dunia menyebabkan pasaran dan ekonomi global jatuh, seterusnya pelabur akan beralih kepada pelaburan yang selamat iaitu emas. Permintaan yang tinggi terhadap emas akan menyebabkan harga emas naik.\n\nKESAN COVID-19 KEPADA EKONOMI MALAYSIA\nCoronavirus atau wabak covid-19 yang merebak seluruh dunia telah memberi impak besar terhadap ekonomi Malaysia. Kejatuhan harga petroleum yang merupakan pendapatan utama malaysia dan kejatuhan industri pelancongan yang merupakan penjana pertukaran asing kedua terbesar menyebabkan Malaysia kehilangan pendapatan yang banyak. Kesan Covid-19 ke atas industri petroleum susulan harga bagi satu tong merosot lebih 50 peratus yang akan mengurangkan pendapatan kerajaan kepada RM30 bilion. Syarikat penerbangan dan industri pelancongan akan mengalami kerugian. Perintah Kawalan Pergerakan Malaysia untuk menyekat penularan covid-19 akan menyebabkan hotel, pengangkutan darat, restoran akan mengalami kerugian dan seterusnya ramai pekerja akan menderita kerana kemungkinan dibuang kerja.\nPakej rangsangan ekonomi susulan penularan wabak Covid-19 membabitkan peningkatan perbelanjaan kerajaan selain menyaksikan penurunan dalam kutipan cukai dan pada masa sama, meskipun sekatan perjalanan separa dikenakan, langkah itu akan mengurangkan perniagaan dan hasil, yang sekali lagi menjejaskan pendapatan kerajaan malaysia. Wabak covid-19 menyebabkan kemelesetan ekonomi seluruh dunia termasuk Malaysia.\n\n \n\nTun Dr Mahathir Mohamed berkata “Sememangnya kita semua sedang berdepan dengan satu bencana yang amat dahsyat.” Klik artikel harian metro oleh Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamed url=https:www.hmetro.com.myutama202003557778kita-berdepan-dengan-bencana-amat-dahsyat-tun-mKITA BERDEPAN DENGAN BENCANA AMAT DAHSYATurl\nKemelesetan ekonomi malaysia akan menyebabkan kejatuhan nilai wang. Kejatuhan nilai ringgit Malaysia akibat kesan kemelesetan global akan menyebabkan harga emas dalam ringgit malaysia akan naik. Harga emas dunia diniagakan dalam dolar amerika iaitu usoz. Maka harga emas dalam sesuatu negara berubah apabila nilai matawang berubah kerana perubahan nilai matawang berbanding matawang dolar. Ini bermaksub, kejatuhan nilai wang akan menaikkan harga emas dalam ringgit malaysia.\n \nCarta Matawang USD dolar dengan MYR Ringgit malaysia boleh dirujuk di https:www.xe.com . Kesan coronavirus telah menyebabkan kejatuhan nilai wang yang teruk dimana kini nilai wang 1 dolar bersamaan RM4.43. Kejatuhan nilai wang akan menaikkan harga emas dalam Malaysia.\n\n\n \nKini harga emas dunia pada paras masih rendah iaitu 1600 usoz dengan harga emas 1g kini lebih kurang RM240 telah mengatasi harga emas tertinggi tahun 2011 pada paras harga emas dunia 1900 usoz yang berharga RM220 segram. Pelik, kini harga emas dunia masih rendah, namun harga emas dalam ringgit Malaysia telah melebihi harga emas tertinggi dunia. Ini adalah disebabkan kejatuhan nilai ringgit malaysia yang menaikkan harga emas Malaysia. Jadi, apabila haarga emas dunia menyamai harga emas tertinggi tahun 2011 iaitu 1900 usoz harga emas dalam ringgit malaysia lebih kurang RM300 segram.

Tetapi kesan covid-19 sebenarnya bukan sahaja wabak penyakit tetapi juga gelombang wabak ekonomi yang memberi kesan yang lebih besar. Sudah bersediakah dengan simpanan kecemasan 6 bulan yang di anjurkan oleh pakar ekonomi ?. Jika telah mempunyai simpanan wang, sebaiknya tukar kepada simpanan emas kerana nilai wang akan berkurang. Jika belum mempunyai simpanan kecemasan 6 bulan gaji, boleh berjimat dengan membeli emas sebagai bekalan kecemasan kerana wabak coronavirus dijangkakan lama dan akan memberi kesan yang lebih besar. Coronavirus bukan saja hadapi wabak penyakit tetapi sedang bertarung dengan wabak ekonomi paling pelik dalam sejarah ketamadunan hidup manusia.\n\nKESAN COVID-19 KEPADA HARGA EMAS\nEmas telah terbukti suatu pelaburan yang selamat walau dalam apa jua keadaan. Coronvirus telah memberi kesan kemelesetan ekonomi global, kejatuhan harga minyak dan pasaran seluruh dunia, namun emas telah membuktikan bahawa emas adalah pelaburan selamat yang luar biasa serta kalis inflasi.\n\n\n\nPada pertengahan bulan Februari, emas mencapai aras psikologi sebanyak $1,600 yang penting dan terus meningkat sejak itu. Sesetengah penganalisis percaya bahawa selagi coronavirus terus memberi impak kepada pasaran, harga emas boleh terus melonjak naik di sepanjang masa tahun 2020 dengan menghampiri $1,900, yang telah berlaku pada tahun 2011.\n \nGoldman Sachs Group Inc menaikkan unjuran apabila COVID-19 memberi tekanan kepada kadar sebenar, sambil fokus kepada pilihan raya Amerika Syarikat (AS) terus meningkatkan permintaan logam berharga itu sebagai aset selamat. Bank itu menaikkan unjuran 12 bulan sebanyak AS$200 dan berkata jika kesan virus merebak sehingga ke suku kedua tahun ini, adalah dijangkakan harga emas akan melepasi AS$1,800 seauns mengikut asas tiga bulan.

  content : Forex Forecast and Cryptocurrency Forecast for March 30 - April 03, 2020\n\n \nFirst, a review of last week’s events:\n  \n- EURUSD. The pair's flights in recent weeks can be compared to aerobatics: first, an almost vertical takeoff up by 630 points, then a vertical peak by 860, and now a new leap up by 445 points.\nSeveral factors caused the sharp drop in the dollar. The main one is the actions of the US Federal Reserve, which lowered the interest rate to 0.25% and launched a number of programs to support the US economy, injecting billions of dollars and distributing money to its citizens. As a result, the Fed's balance sheet exceeded a record 4.5 trillion dollars, and according to economists' calculations, it may even reach 6 trillion dollars. As a result, US stock indexes flew up, the S&P500 jumped by as much as 20%, pulling the EURUSD pair with it: investors reacted positively to the steps taken by the US leadership and began to turn away from the dollar as a safe haven asset, preferring more attractive assets at the moment. \nThe ECB's coronavirus-related decision helped the European currency as well. Previously, the ECB could buy no more than a third of a country's public debt under the quantitative easing (QE) program, but now the Bank has removed this restriction, which has had a positive impact on the yield of Eurobonds and contributed to the growth of the euro. \nIt should be noted that 60% of experts expected the pair to return to the 1.1000-1.1240 zone within a month, and 75% during the quarter. But, as practice shows, the COVID-19 pandemic serves as a powerful catalyst or driver, repeatedly speeding up market processes. So, it happened this time: the pair reached the set goal not in a quarter, nor even in a month, but in just five days, putting the final point on Friday, March 27 at 1.1140;\n\n- GBPUSD. Macroeconomic indicators such as the business activity index (PMI) indicate a contraction of the UK economy, to protect which the Bank of England has twice lowered the interest rate and increased the volume of bond purchases by ?200 billion over the past two months. However, at the last meeting, the leaders of this regulator unanimously voted against further reducing the rate and keeping it at 0.1%. It was also decided to leave the volume of bond purchases unchanged, at the level of ?645 billion. This indicates that the Bank of England considers the measures taken at this stage sufficient.\nThe impact of the coronavirus on the UK economy will become more apparent after we learn the results of the first quarter of 2020. So far, the situation here looks little better than in the EU and the US. Support for the pound is now also provided by the ability of the Government of this country to print its own money, without any agreements with the EU.\nThe bounce of the GBPUSD pair up last week looks even more impressive than the growth of EURUSD: the British pound took away more than 830 points from the dollar. Recall that on March 20, it fell to the lowest values for the last 230 (!) years, and from 70% to 80% of analysts expected that, having fought off this bottom, the pound will be able to return to the zone of 1.2725-1.3025 during April-May. So far, this forecast is justified: the pair completed the five-day period on the way to the set goal, at the level of 1.2470;\n\n- USDJPY. The end of March turned out to be favorable for the Japanese currency, whose quotes, as usual, depend on the risk appetite of investors, oil prices and the yield of US government bonds.\nThe forecast, which was supported by the majority of experts, turned out to be correct by 99.9% if not by 100%. According to it, the pair should have turned south and headed to the 107.00-107.70 zone. This happened in fact: after making several attempts to break through the resistance of 111.60, the bulls gave up, and the bears very quickly lowered the pair by 385 points – to the level of 107.75, near which – at the level of 107.95 – it ended the trading session;\n\n– cryptocurrencies. We suggested in the previous forecast that Bitcoin quotes can be used as a leading indicator for forecasts for major dollar pairs. The main idea was that a lull in the crypto market during financial storms can be a harbinger of a trend change or a strong correction for EURUSD. According to the voiced theory, the transition of the BTCUSD pair to a flat state in the conditions of continued over-volatility in other markets may indicate that the dollar has reached critical values, and large speculators do not know what to do, whether to increase dollar assets by selling BTC, or, on the contrary, to convert fiat into cryptocurrency.\nOf course, this is only a theory, with many reservations, but last week it was confirmed: the charts show a flat in the crypto market and a predicted sharp reversal of the trend for EURUSD.\nBitcoin has risen in price by less than 9% over the past seven days, Ripple (XRPUSD) – by 10%, Litecoin (LTCUSD) – by 3%, and the growth of Ethereum (ETHUSD) was less than 1%.\nBy the way, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently presented a roadmap for the development of ETH for the next 5-10 years. In addition, he called for the development of decentralized bridges between Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies and for the creation of a \real\ decentralized exchange (DEX) for the exchange of BTC and ETH. However, judging by the Ethereum quotes, his ideas have not yet found a response in the hearts and wallets of investors.\n\n\nAs for the forecast for the coming week, summarizing the opinions of a number of experts, as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis, we can say the following:\n\n- EURUSD. After winning back 50% of the losses of the previous two weeks, the pair eventually returned to the Pivot Point 1.1100 zone, around which it has been rotating for many months, starting from the end of July 2019. This suggests that the market does not know what else to expect from the coronavirus and from the governments that have entered the fight against it.\nOn the one hand, we can observe an avalanche-like increase in the number of diseases in the United States, and it is unknown whether President Trump and his administration will have the strength and ability not just to take control, but to seriously improve the situation. A significant part of the money that the Fed is pouring into the country's economy goes to pay unemployment benefits and one-time payments to individuals who... are quarantined and can't spend it. As a result, these funds will not reach the real sector of the economy in the near future. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin exudes optimism, saying that the current situation is not yet a financial crisis. However, the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, already agrees that the US economy \may well be in recession\, and the agenda is now dictated by the virus. And it is possible that a severe recession may turn into a depression at some point.\nOn the other hand, the situation in Europe is no better. The results of the EU summit held on Thursday, March 26, were described by some analysts as \simply terrible\. The representatives of the countries did not manage to reach a common opinion, the idea of European \corona bonds\ is buried (at least for a while), and the ECB is having a hard time maintaining stability in the euro area. According to a number of experts, such disunity of the EU member states severely limits the opportunities for strengthening the European currency.\nAt the moment, the graphical analysis points to the north, the vast majority of indicators look in the same direction, and only 15% of the oscillators on H4 and D1 give signals about the EURUSD pair being overbought.  \nAmong experts, the majority (60%) is also set to continue the growth of the pair, while the remaining 40% voted for the fall. Resistance levels (taking into account current volatility) are 1.1240, 1.1365 and 1.1500, support levels are 1.1000, 1.0850, 1.0775 and 1.0635. Well, two seemingly unattainable goals (although, at present, everything is possible): bullish – 1.1800, bearish – 1.0550.\nAs for the release of macroeconomic indicators, data on unemployment and the consumer market in Germany and the Eurozone as a whole will be available on Monday, March 30 and Tuesday, March 31. And the second half of the week will bring us a whole avalanche of data on the US labor market. Let's just say that in all cases, the forecasts are disappointing. For example, the number of jobs created outside the us agricultural sector (NFP) is expected to fall from plus 273K to minus 123K;\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n- GBPUSD. Assessing the prospects for the British economy, chief economist at IHS Markit, Chris Williamson, almost repeated what Jerome Powell said about the American. \The onset of a recession of unprecedented scale in modern history is becoming more likely,\ – this is the prophecy of Williamson. And even the UK's exit from the EU does not have such a negative impact on the economy as COVID-19.\nIn this context, despite the medium-term forecast, 60% of analysts expect a downward trend reversal and the beginning of a new phase of the pound's fall in the next week. If we talk about technical analysis, the H4 timeframe is dominated by green, but 20% of the oscillators are already in the overbought zone. The signals of oscillators and trend indicators on D1 can be described as multidirectional.\nGraphical analysis on both timeframes supports the bearish forecast but assumes that the pair will stay in the range of 1.2250-1.2600 for some time before going down sharply.\nThe resistance levels are 1.2600, 1.2750, 1.3025, 1.3200 and 1.3515. Support levels are 1.2250, 1.2200, 1.1800 and 1.1450;\n\n- USDJPY. The pair ended the last week near the strong supportresistance level of 108.00, and most analysts (60%), as in the case of EURUSD and GBPUSD, expect a trend reversal and subsequent strengthening of the dollar. If this happens, the pair has quite a lot of chances to still overcome the 111.60-112.00 mark and rise another 100 points higher. The nearest strong resistance is in the area of 109.70-110.00.\nThe remaining 40% of experts, supported by graphical analysis on H4, side with the bears. Support is in the zones 106.70-107.25 and 104.70-105.00, further targets are 103.00 and the March 09 low in the area of 101.00;\n\n– cryptocurrencies. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index moved just 3 points over the week, from 9 to 12, and still indicates the presence of a strong fear in the market. At the same time, the number of requests for the word \Bitcoin\ in the search engines Baidu and Google has grown significantly over the past month, and most users are interested in buying cryptocurrency. So, the number of requests increased by 138% over the past month in the Baidu search engine, and according to Google Trends, the growth was 57%.\nAs usual, the growth of the reference cryptocurrency is predicted by all sorts of crypto gurus, especially since now they have a powerful ally in the person of the COVID-19 coronavirus. So, the well-known analyst Joseph Young expressed confidence in the positive impact on Bitcoin of the measures taken by the US Federal Reserve to stimulate the American economy. \The Fed endlessly prints money to pump the markets — this is good for Bitcoin. The devaluation of the dollar in the long run is good for Bitcoin. The short-term prospects may be bleak for this cryptocurrency, but the long-term outlook remains very bright, \ he said. \nMike Novogratz, the founder of Galaxy Digital, also agrees with Young. He is confident that the global economic crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic will be the time of Bitcoin's breakthrough. \Bitcoin will remain volatile for the next few months, but the macroeconomic backdrop is what it was created for. This year should be and will be the year of BTC,\ the billionaire said.\nPhilip Salter, Operating Director of Genesis Mining, joins this chorus of voices. He is convinced that the deepening economic crisis will lead to an increase in the popularity of Bitcoin as a tool for hedging the risks of the banking system. \If the development of the economic crisis can be prevented, there will be no major changes to Bitcoin. However, if there is a real collapse, the interest in the first cryptocurrency will take off. The more skepticism about the old economy, the more interest in bitcoin, \ the top manager of this popular cloud mining service shared his thoughts.\nAs for the nearest forecasts, the well-known trader Ton Weiss is sure that with the current Bitcoin quotes, the probability of falling below the recent low of $3800 is 20-25%. The first cryptocurrency will have even less chance of collapsing to such levels if it overcomes the $6800 level - just 15%. \Going above the $6800 level will give me 85% confidence that we will not go below this level,\ -Weiss States. In general, 55% of experts expect that the BTCUSD pair will reach the $7,500-8,000 zone within the next few weeks. The remaining 45% of analysts, on the contrary, predict a fall in the pair. In their opinion, BTCUSD will once again try to test the support of $5,700 and, if successful, will again be at the level of $5,000.\n\n\nNordFX Analytical Group\n\n\nNotice: These materials should not be deemed a recommendation for investment or guidance for working on financial markets: they are for informative purposes only.

  content : CryptoNews\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n- Microsoft has published a patent application for a device called “Cryptocurrency system that uses data on body activity.” Apparently, the device will be designed to use human energy for mining cryptocurrencies. The document says that this will be a set of sensors with a module that converts the energy of the human body. According to some experts, \brain waves in the process of human activity emit a huge amount of energy, and this type of activity can easily be translated into computing power.\ Microsoft representatives have not yet commented on the new product, however, according to insider information, the device may appear on sale before the beginning of 2021, unless it is an April Fool’s joke.\n\n- Messari analyst Cao Wang believes that Bitcoin's dominance in the cryptocurrency market may exceed 90% by the end of the crisis, instead of the current 66%. According to the expert, \during the period of the entire market drawdown, large investors prefer to work with proven cryptocurrencies. Most often, they choose Bitcoin, since its volatility does not look potentially dangerous. Other coins do not show so good results. We can single out Ethereum among the promising assets, but even it is currently trading in the red zone.\ \nCao Wang also drew attention to the fact that many investors prefer to invest in the US dollar at the moment. However, if the global crisis becomes even larger, some of them will rush to the cryptocurrency market, where, due to lack of experience, they will buy Bitcoin, considering it the main and most reliable digital currency.\n\n- Option traders believe that Bitcoin will not be able to update the historical high of $20,000 this year. According to the Skew analytical platform, the probability of this event is only 4%. Experts say that the May halving has ceased to be a driver of future growth rate of the asset. In all the options that analysts have studied, an extremely small part of speculators bet on Bitcoin exceeding the $10,000 mark. Most of the traders believe that the cryptocurrency will continue to trade in the range of $5,000-6,000.\n\n- The CEO of the largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance Changpeng Zhao is often criticized for his overly expressive statements that can encourage subscribers to take irresponsible actions. This time, Zhao called for the purchase of Bitcoins, even on credit. \An insane amount of money will soon flow into the financial system. Buy cryptocurrencies with your Visa cards, \ Zhao tweeted.\nSamson Mow, Chief Strategy Officer at Blockstream, agrees with Changpeng Zhao. In his opinion, the decision of the US Federal Reserve to print $6.2 trillion to maintain liquidity in connection with the economic crisis makes an excellent advertisement for Bitcoin, which was created just to counterbalance the rampant monetary printing press. \How much did we pay Trump to advertise Bitcoin?\- joked the top manager.\nBut another well-known analyst and trader, Peter Brandt, believes that Bitcoin may have \big problems\ if it can't demonstrate steady growth against the backdrop of the fall of the traditional financial market.\n\n- According to the analytical service Glassnode, the number of wallets containing at least one BTC coin has grown by 60% in three years and reached a record high of 800 thousand. The previous record was set at the end of 2017, when the exchange rate of the main digital coin set a historical high at $20,000. At that time, the number of such wallets was about 720 thousand. Since then, the number of addresses with a balance of at least one coin has been growing all the time, with the exception of the end of 2018, when the Bitcoin exchange rate collapsed to $3,200, their number fell to 690 thousand.\nCryptocurrency exchanges Kraken, OKEx, Bitfinex, Paxful and Luno also reported an increase in the number of new users against the background of the coronavirus. According to Kraken, the number of registrations on their platform has increased by 83%. \This influx of new users to the exchange is not due to the fact that people have nothing to do in quarantine during the pandemic. Most likely, people want to use the crisis and gain independence from the \outdated\ financial system,\ says Pierre Rochard, a specialist in strategic development at Kraken.\n\n - Hackers have recently repeatedly broken into popular accounts on YouTube and have used them to arrange fake distributions of cryptocurrencies on behalf of famous people. This time, the scammers hacked more than thirty different YouTube channels, renamed them to allegedly various Microsoft brands, and broadcast through them a speech by Bill Gates in June 2019. At the same time, along with the \live broadcast\, the scammers showed ads for a \prize draw\, in which users were asked to send a certain amount in cryptocurrencies, which they allegedly would double in response.\n\n- The Kraken exchange believes that the price of Bitcoin may reach $350,000 by 2044. This will be facilitated by the transition of a $68 trillion inheritance of capital from the \baby boomers\ to the younger generations. Kraken experts gave a quantitative assessment of the potential flow of inherited capital into Bitcoin. According to their base scenario, with a tax of 2% and a peak of placing funds in the cryptocurrency at 5% of inherited assets, the inflow of investment in Bitcoin will be $971 billion. Based on the difference between the current issue of BTC and the expected figure for 2044, the price of the main cryptocurrency can reach $349,255. Even according to the most conservative estimate of exchange specialists, it will be around $70,000. \n\n\neurusd gbpusd usdjpy usdchf forex forex_example signals forex cryptocurrencies bitcoin,

  content : Bitcoin ended the first quarter of 2020 down from the start of the year, but not as badly as the record-setting losses suffered by global equities. \n\nFor the full quarter, the Nikkei 225 was down 20 percent, the worst three-month showing for the Tokyo-based index since 2008. The FTSE lost 14 percent for the period, its second-worst quarterly performance ever, beating only the fourth quarter of 1987. The S&P 500 was in the red 18 percent to close out Q1 2020, its worst quarter since 1938. \n\nCryptocurrencies operate 247 and don't have quarters for closing the books. However, bitcoin, the market bellwether, was down just 10 percent for 2020’s first three months.\n\n?

  content : CORONAVIRUS: NOT TIME TO GET SICK, TIME TO PROFIT\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nBecause of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, the crypto market, Forex, and exchanges are all going down. \This is a great time to make a profit! Go to quarantine, stay at home and ... earn!\- experts of the brokerage company NordFX advise\n\n\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic continues to control the global markets. Countries are being quarantined, factories and offices are empty, and authorities are urging their citizens not to leave their homes. Of course, it is a forced measure, and there is nothing good about it. But there is still one advantage there: now we have much more time not only for active trading, but also for training and improving our own trading strategies.   \n\nUntil recently, many crypto gurus convinced us to invest in Bitcoin, which, they said, was to protect us in the event of a crisis in the traditional markets. However, the onset of the coronavirus proved the complete failure of this theory: it turned out that instead of growing, the main cryptocurrency can fall very quickly along with currencies, oil and stock indexes.\nIn just one month from February 12 to March 13, it lost 58% in price, dropping from $10,340 to $4,300. On some exchanges, the drop was even greater: up to $3,815, and reached 63%. Bitcoin lost up to half of its value only in one day from March 12 to 13, dragging the entire crypto market to the bottom. Quite a safe haven!\n\nAnd if passive investors who invested money in Bitcoin in the hope that its price, as a result of the halving or just for no reason, will soar to the cosmic heavens, experience only disappointment, active traders, on the contrary, have received another opportunity to make a large profit.  \n\nRecall that international brokers such as NordFX, unlike crypto exchanges, provide traders with significantly more opportunities to increase their capital.\n\nFirst, NordFX clients have the opportunity to earn both on the growth and the fall of cryptocurrencies, which is very important in the conditions of such a high market volatility. At the same time, in order to make money on the fall of the Bitcoin, you do not need to have it at all: trading is similar to the CFD contracts for difference. You just open a sell trade in the trading terminal, and if the coin quotes go down, you will get a profit.\n\nSecondly, this profit can be very high, because the broker provides its clients with the opportunity of margin trading. So, you just need the following to open trades on cryptocurrency pairs in NordFX:\n- $150 to open a position of 1 Bitcoin\n- $15 to open a position of 1 Ethereum\n- $0.3 to open a position of 1 EOS\n- $0.02 to open a position of 1 Ripple.\n\nThat is, to buy or sell 1 Bitcoin at the current price, you do not need to have $6000, but only $150 is enough, which allows you to make a profit 40 times greater than in normal trading without margin. So, in just one month from February 12 to March 13, you could have made a profit of 4000% on the fall of BTC.\n\nIn total, NordFX clients have the opportunity to make transactions with 11 cryptocurrency pairs. The order execution speed is less than 0.5 seconds. Deposits are in US dollars, Bitcoins or Ethereum at the customer's choice, and the minimum deposit is only $10.\n\nAnd third, another important point is the ability to hedge transactions on cryptocurrencies, opening parallel positions on the Forex market (33 currency pairs), or trading gold, silver, oil, shares of leading global companies or major stock indices such as Nasdaq, Dow Jones, Nikkei, etc. And here, just as in the case of cryptocurrencies, you can earn not only on the growth of the price of these assets, but also on its fall. At the same time, the broker will immediately, automatically and without any collateral provide you with a leverage of up to 1:1000 for currency pairs. That is, if you have, for example, only $100, you can make transactions worth $100,000. \n\nSumming up the above, we can say that the onset of the coronavirus is not a time to indulge in boredom, discouragement, and even more so, panic. This is a time to earn money, and self-isolation can bring real benefits to your health and finances. Quarantines begin and end, life goes on!   \n\nNotice: These materials are not investment recommendations or guidelines for working in financial markets and are intended for informational purposes only. Trading in financial markets is risky and can result in a complete loss of deposited funds.\n\n\neurusd gbpusd usdjpy usdchf forex forex_example signals forex cryptocurrencies bitcoin,

  content : Forex and Cryptocurrency Forecast for April 06 - 10, 2020\n\n \nFirst, a review of last week’s events:\n  \n- EURUSD. The German unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5% in March. But the data on the US labor market looks just terrifying: 6.648 million applications for unemployment benefits, this figure has increased by 10 million in two weeks, which is equivalent to 6% of the entire labor force. The number of new jobs created outside the agricultural sector went down: -705K in March instead of +275K in February. Other indicators are no better. It is possible that the unemployment will jump higher than during the great depression. And at the same time, the dollar has been growing all week, taking away more than 350 points from the euro, which indicates that the market was already ready for such a collapse of the US economy and took this into account in its quotes in advance. The dollar was also helped by statements from President Trump and the Saudi Energy Ministry about a possible return to the negotiations in the OPEC+ format and an end to the oil war. Although, there is as little clarity on this front as on the front of the fight against the COVID-19 coronavirus.    \nAt the end of the week, having made a five-day walk to the south this time, the EURUSD pair reached a strong supportresistance zone around 1.0800, where it set the final chord;\n\n- GBPUSD. The most accurate forecast for this pair was given by graphical analysis, which predicted the sideways movement of the pair, which looks truly amazing. The pair stayed in the range of 1.2245-1.2485 for the whole week, and the scope of its fluctuations did not exceed 240 points, which, according to the current violent times, can be considered a flat. Some analysts believe that the reason for this is the increased interest of investors in the sharply cheaper pound in the first two decades of March, which leveled the current problems in the British economy;\n\n- USDJPY. A similar pattern to the GBPUSD is also visible on the chart of this pair, which also stayed in a 180-point wide side channel all week (106.90-108.70). And this is despite the fact that the dollar index for the week rose by 2.5%. One of the versions that explains this behavior of both pairs is that investors and speculators were so caught up in the struggle between the two \titans\, the dollar and the Euro, that they postponed a serious game on the pound and the yen for the future, when it is clear what is happening with the two leading economies of the world and what the next actions of their regulators are;\n\n – cryptocurrencies. Recall that when analyzing the situation on the crypto market, we use a seven-day interval from previous Saturday to current Friday. The volatility of BTCUSD during this period was about 23%: having fallen on Monday, March 30 to the level of $5,870, the pair turned around and reached its peak of $7,260 on Thursday, April 02, followed by a rebound down, and the quotes were again below the level of $7,000. If you look at the chart, you can clearly see that for three weeks now, the bulls have been persistently trying to break through this resistance and gain a foothold above $7,000, but to no success so far. Due to the crisis caused by the coronavirus, investors are quite cautious, not risking transferring large amounts of fiat into cryptocurrencies. During the week, the market capitalization of the crypto market has not changed and is at the level of $256 billion. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index does not leave the red zone: it was at 9 two weeks ago, seven days later its value was 12, and now it is 14 out of 100 possible, which still indicates the presence of a strong fear in the market. \nAs for such top altcoins as Ripple (XRPUSD), Litecoin (LTCUSD) and Ethereum (ETHUSD), they, following the main cryptocurrency, also formed figures called \ascending triangle\, trying to rise and gain a foothold above their own resistance zones: Ripple – above $0.18, Litecoin – $41, and Ethereum – $145.\n\n\nAs for the forecast for the coming week, summarizing the opinions of a number of experts, as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis, we can say the following:\n\n- EURUSD. The regulators, both the Fed and the ECB, are now trying to put out the fire by flooding their markets with cheap money. But the fire of the corona crisis was so strong that it could not be controlled quickly. The data on the US economy for March leaves one speechless. But this is not all, the data for April, which we will see in a month, may look much more dramatic. In addition, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet is growing day by day, and its policy of easing reduces the attractiveness of the dollar as a safe haven currency. These arguments allow analysts at Nordea Markets to say that the EURUSD pair is more likely to return to 1.1500 rather than to fall to 1.0000.\nOn the other hand, even in the Eurozone, despite the current account surplus, things are not running smoothly. Germany and other Northern European countries that are members of the EU have recently rejected the offer of Italy, France, Spain and six other Euro zone countries to issue joint bonds – coronabonds. Whether they can overcome their differences will become clear in the very near future, on Tuesday, April 07, a meeting of the Eurogroup consisting of EU Finance Ministers is due to take place, and on Wednesday, April 08, the ECB meeting on monetary policy will be held. Also, the results of the OPEC meeting on Monday April 06 and the results of the Fed meeting on April 08 may affect the formation of trends.\nMeanwhile, 65% of experts, supported by graphical analysis on H4, 75% of oscillators and 90% of trend indicators, expect the downtrend to continue and the pair will decline to the lows of March 20-23 in the 1.0650 zone. The next support is at the level of 1.0500, the goal is the low of 1.0340 on January 01, 2017. \nIt should be noted that when switching from a weekly to a medium-term forecast, the situation changes radically, and here 65% of analysts expect that the pair will turn around at the end of April – in May, first it will return to the height of 1.1100, then 1.1240, and eventually rise to the level of 1.1500. At the same time, 45% of experts do not exclude that this may happen in the nearest future;\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n- GBPUSD. After such a difficult decision to leave the EU, the British regulators are doing everything possible to stabilize the economic situation. Against this background, 20% of analysts, in agreement with the graphical analysis on D1, expect the pair's sideways trend to continue in the range of 1.2245-1.2485. 50% of experts expect the channel to break down and reduce the pair to the 1.1640-1.1940 zone. The remaining 30%, on the contrary, side with the bulls, indicating the resistance levels of 1.2475, 1.2625 and 1.2840. As for the indicators, while most of the trend indicators are colored red, there is a complete discord among the oscillators: 25% on D1 signal that the pair is overbought, and the same amount on H4 show that it is oversold;\n\n- USDJPY. 60% of analysts expect from this pair a breakout of the 108.70 resistance and a strengthening of the dollar to the level of 111.65. Further growth of the pair remains in question, as several attempts between March 20 and 25 were unsuccessful.\nBear supporters among experts are now a minority - 40%, the nearest goal is to return to the lower border of the corridor 106.90-108.70. If it is broken through, the pair will first rush to the support of 105.00, then to 103.15, and then to the low of March 09 at the level of 101.15. It is difficult to say how long the pair will be able to cover this distance but considering the recent flights of 700 points a week, it can happen quite quickly.\nAs for the indicators, the discord is similar to the GBPUSD. On H4, 70% of trend indicators and 75% of oscillators are colored green, while the rest are red. On D1, the picture is diametrically opposite. A compromise situation is offered by graphical analysis on H4: first growth to the zone of 111.00, then a sharp drop first to the support of 108.00, and then another 100 points lower;\n\n– cryptocurrencies. Messari analyst Cao Wang believes that the dominance of Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency market by the end of the crisis may exceed 90%, instead of the current 66%, as large investors prefer to work with the most reliable and proven coins during the market drawdown. At the same time, according to the Skew analytical platform, based on a survey of option trading participants, the BTCUSD pair will not be able to update the historical maximum of $20,000 this year, the probability of this event is only 4%. An extremely small part of option speculators bets even on a growth above the $10,000 mark.\nHowever, investors are still pinning their hopes on the printing press launched by the Central banks of the leading countries due to the crisis. \An insane amount of money will soon be poured into the financial system,\ Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance crypto exchange, tweeted. Samson Mow, Chief Strategy Officer at Blockstream, agrees with him. In his opinion, the decision of the US Federal Reserve to print $6.2 trillion makes an excellent advertisement for Bitcoin, which was created just just to counterbalance the rampant monetary printing press. It is logical that, with the surplus of the fiat subject to depreciation, investors will again turn to the cryptocurrency market, and the BTC quotes will go up sharply.\nThe data from the analytical service Glassnode also look optimistic, according to which the number of wallets containing at least one BTC coin has reached a record high of 800 thousand. Cryptocurrency exchanges Kraken, OKEx, Bitfinex, Paxful and Luno have also reported an increase in the number of new users against the background of the coronavirus. For example, according to Kraken, the number of registrations on their platform has increased by 83%.\nAs for the pessimists, we can refer to the well-known analyst and trader Peter Brandt, who believes that Bitcoin may have \big problems\ if it can not demonstrate steady growth against the background of the fall of the traditional financial market.\nAnd in conclusion, another very long-term forecast, which will undoubtedly please even those who once purchased Bitcoin for $20,000 and since then have been watching its quotes with sadness. According to Kraken experts, the price of Bitcoin can reach $350,000 by 2044, which should be facilitated by the transition in the form of a $68 trillion inheritance from \baby boomers\ to younger, \digital\ generations. So, it's not a total loss, ladies and gentlemen!\n\n\nNordFX Analytical Group\n\n\nNotice: These materials should not be deemed a recommendation for investment or guidance for working on financial markets: they are for informative purposes only.

  content : The panic around the virus is huge, but a hefty of critics are still claiming that the virus will help the elites to control the whole planet legally. Let's look a the scary picture and tell if the conspiracy theorists can start worrying more.\n\n\The Coronavirus Pandemic Will Forever Alter The World Order\ - Henry Kissinger says in 2020.\n\nYour neighbor, mom or dad could tell you that coronavirus is 'political case'. But what if not? What if politics have nothing to do with the spread, and Mother Nature is delivering revenge on a random basis? In any case, this is a huge chance to take some liberties away from people. For instance, the anonymity provided by cash. Because the coronavirus related changes will be irreversible. And cash is one of the public enemies in terms of contamination issues.\n\nThe first countries to use public cameras and cellphone data to precisely track coronavirus contacts were China, Israel and Singapore. Combine legalization of such systems with centrally controlled stablecoin payment system and ban on cash and you'll get a pretty Orwellish picture.\n\nCoronavirus Says Goodbye to Cash Bills, Hence Anonymity\n\n...Cryptocurrencies created by governments will impose cheap, fast, contactless transactions.\n\nThey will feature blockchain technology. They will have backing in a form of fiat money, stocks or even gold and silver. Perhaps they will have no backing like Bitcoin, gaining value from the hard cap on the monetary supply. But such CBDC's will certainly require KYC, and the tools will be in use to track the user's wallets and transactions. This means that, if people accept such stablecoin, the government can stop supporting the paper cash...\n\nCentral Banks Have Suddenly Woke Up to Stablecoins\n\n...Christine Lagarde, current ECB head and former IMF head, was talking about blockchain implementation since November 2018. At the end of January 2020, she reclaimed thoughts that the stablecoin idea is cool:\n\n“My personal conviction is that giving the developments we are seeing, not so much in the bitcoin segment, but in the stablecoins projects. And we only know of one at the moment but there are others, being explored and underway at the moment. We’d better be ahead of the curve if that happens. Because there is clearly a demand out there that we have to respond to.”...\n\nGovernments Can Legally Spy on People?\n\n...The Health factor is the one considered the most vulnerable one when we look close to mass psychology. People are ready to accept any measures to stop the virus from spreading....\n\nRead Moar \n\nhttps:telegra.phCoronavirus-Cash-Killer-CBDC-Booster-and-Legal-Surveillance-Cover-04-07\n\nAuthor subscribery: \nhttps:t.meCrypto0racle,

  content : An active investor and research analyst called Sergeenkov’s Blog has posted a price analysis about OKB after 3 Months of trading. Please click the above link to look over the whole article. All right reserved by Sergeekov’s Blog.\nSummary\nWhy has OKB outperformed a majority of crypto assets?\nOKT, the native token of OKChain, will be issued to resolve the dilemma that the inflation of exchange tokens will destroy the public chain ecosystems.\nThe creative token design of OKB and OKT is helpful to eliminate the issues most of the other exchanges are facing.\nWhile countries like the US have set plans in motion to jump-start their economies, investors, on the other hand, are coming to terms with market uncertainties against the backdrop of the downtrodden state of the global economy. However, in the crypto scape, market experts are predicting a possible rebound of digital asset prices, even as crypto firms continue to show no signs of slowing down amid the coronavirus scare.\nLeading the charge are crypto exchanges, which, to an extent, have conditioned their businesses to withstand crisis borne out of extreme volatility. One of such exchanges is OKEx. OKB, issued by OK Blockchain Foundation, is accepted by the exchange as a global utility token, and it has stood out as one of the best performing cryptocurrencies in the market since the start of the year. Here, we will explore the price trend of OKB and the underlying factors propelling its viability.\nOKB Performed Since 2020 Kicked Off\nThe price of OKB stood at the $4.30 mark, up 3.82% in the last 24 hours. This development reiterates, albeit to a lesser degree, the price response of the token whenever the OKEx ecosystem achieves a milestone. It will interest you to know that the price of OKB at the beginning of January was $2.30. Hence, regardless of the economic downturn resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, OKB has managed to sustain a positive price movement in 2020.\nIn January alone, the token recorded a 25% surge in valuation and a 34.1% monthly fluctuation in the OKBUSDT crypto pair. In mid-February, OKB continued its uptrend and reached an all-time high of $7.51, with ROI hitting a staggering 322.29%. However, in tandem with the overall performance of the crypto market and the global economy as a whole, OKB experienced extreme volatility in March that caused its price to fall steeply. At the height of this downtrend, the token sold for $2.59. Nonetheless, the digital asset has shown a slow but steady recovery, sparking speculation as regards the viability of the crypto asset in current market conditions.\nWhy Has OKB Outperformed A Majority of Crypto Assets?\nThere are several factors responsible for OKB’s impressive price run in 2020. The unprecedented spike in the price of OKB in February was linked to the announcement of the OKChain testnet. OKChain ushers in a new frontier for the OKEx ecosystem. It provides all the benefits of a multi-layered public blockchain for decentralized applications. Also, OKT, the native token of OKChain, will be issued to resolve the dilemma that the inflation of exchange tokens will destroy the public chain ecosystems. By theory, the token price will keep increasing, but it is in contrast to the development of chain systems because developers won’t be able to afford the cost for building DApps and they would speculate on the token price rather than using them to work on their products. According to the announcement, the exchange decided to map 100% of OKT produced from the genesis block to OKB holders, which could be a driving force to OKB price increase.\nOther developments fueling the OKB narrative include the move by OKEx to increase its crypto storage support capacity with key partnerships, an introduction of the Euro deposit channel, and expanding availability beyond the OKEx ecosystem. Importantly, the exchange has opted for a unique deflation framework, albeit with familiar value-retainment elements.\n“The creative token design of OKB and OKT is helpful to eliminate the issues most of the other exchanges are facing right now — the deflation of exchange token will destroy their chain ecosystem” said Jay Hao, CEO of OKEx, “ OKEx has always take our users’ interests as the first priority by diligently listening to our community, creating substantial values to our supporters. This year, developing the OKB ecosystem will be our top priority task, and I believe OKB holders will enjoy a much wider variety of benefits in the long-term period.”\nTo ensure that OKB is impervious to inflation, the platform made drastic changes to its supply mechanism. The Malta-based exchange adopted a buyback and burn program. OKEx has used a fraction of its revenue (officially 30%) from spot trading to fund this program and reduce the number of OKB tokens in circulation. Out of the 1 billion OKB created, OKEx has already burned all unissued tokens totalling 700 million OKB. With the help of the implemented buyback and burn program, the exchange has reduced its circulating supply from 300 million OKB to 282 million OKB. Hence, the token is the first digital asset to attain absolute deflation, which experts believe has an immeasurable impact on the price trend of the token.\nIt is difficult to gauge how much impact this novel deflation mechanism will have on the future price of OKB. Similarly, there are no templates viable enough to test the viability of OKEx’s push to cut off the supply of its native token. However, one thing is certain: OKB is one of the digital assets spearheading the projected altcoin season of 2020.\nOKBUSDT Price Analysis\nAt pixel time 2351 HRs UTC+3, OKB was up seven percent in the last 24 hours. Remarkably, its trading volumes had shot up 40 percent.\nPrices are trading within a tight trade range and notably oscillating inside Mar 11 and 12 bear candlesticks.\nHowever, unless there is a sharp uptick of prices above Mar 19 high of $4.8, reversing sharp losses of Mar 11, candlestick arrangements suggest that OKB may slide back below $3.8 towards $2.\nOn the flip side, a close above $5 could see bulls flow back and OKB rally to February high of $7.5.\nDisclosure: This is the opinion of the author and is not investment or trading advice. Do your own research.\nDisclosure: Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.,

  content : bThe US Congress, and later the Senate, approved a $2 Trillion stimulus bill that will cushion American taxpayers as well as businesses, from the devastating effects of the Coronavirus.b\n\nThe initial draft of the bill had explored the use of a Digital dollar to distribute funds to affected individuals. The bill had floated the idea of banks creating and maintaining digital dollar wallets for individuals and business entities. However, the concept of a digital dollar was left out in the final bill that was later approved by both houses.\n\nWhy the Idea of a Digital Dollar is Bullish for Bitcoin\nThe mentioning of a digital dollar and provision of digital wallets by banks, ignited some excitement amongst crypto enthusiasts who found this move very bullish for Bitcoin (BTC) as shall be explained.\nSecondly, the implementation of a digital dollar would open the doors for other countries who will not want to be left behind in digitizing their national currencies beyond internal CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currencies). With the global smartphone penetration estimated at 42% of the global population, roughly 3.2 Billion individuals will potentially have access to Bitcoin as a result.\n\nThirdly, once global currencies are digitized on the blockchain, other financial products such as securities, bonds and commodities will follow suit en masse. The probability of such tokenized assets being traded alongside Bitcoin is high. Therefore, such exposure would eventually legitimize BTC to many institutional and retail traders who had first considered it a fad or bubble\n\n url=https:koinpost.comwhy-the-idea-of-a-digital-dollar-is-bullish-for-bitcoin-btcSource and full articleurl\n\nWhat do you guys think? seen governments address these kinda methods especially in those times make me cringe, just hypocrisy in its prime I love it though,

  content : Forex and Cryptocurrency Forecast for April 13 - 17, 2020\n\n \nFirst, a review of last week’s events:\n  \n- EURUSD. The Old and the New Worlds continue to compete to see who will pour more money into their economies. But what is the old Europe compared to the United States! On Thursday, April 10, after many days of discussion, the EU Finance Ministers narrowly reached a compromise, concluding a deal on measures to support their countries in the amount of \some\ €500 billion. At the same time, the US Federal Reserve announced the launch of another $2.3 trillion support program. At the same time, the Head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, said that his Department will most likely not stop there and will do everything in order to restore the US economy as quickly as possible after the epidemic.\nPowell is to be trusted in this regard. And the point here is not only the COVID-19, but also that 2020 is the year of the next US Presidential election, and Donald Trump really wants to stay in the White House for a second term. The growth of the US economy has been a major asset in his fight for the presidency.\nThe unwinding flywheel of the quantitative easing program in the United States could not but put pressure on the dollar, and the USDX index closed trading below the psychological level of 100.0 on April 09. As for the EURUSD pair, the dollar began to retreat starting from Monday. However, this retreat was not as panicky as in the last week of March, when the pair overcame 510 points. Now the euro has grown by less than 200 points, after which the pair ended the five-day period in the 1.0940 zone, and did not reach the landmark level of 1.1000;\n\n- GBPUSD. The dollar retreated against the pound as well. Besides the above, an additional factor that supported the British currency was the continued growth of borrowing rates in pounds in London and a decrease in borrowing rates in US dollars.\nRecall that, giving a forecast for the past week, 20% of analysts had expected the continuation of the sideways trend of the pair in the range of 1.2245-1.2485, and another 30% – its movement from the lower to the upper border of this channel, indicating the level of 1.2475 as resistance. As a result, the overall forecast of these experts turned out to be correct: having failed to fall below the support of 1.2200, the pair turned north and ended the trading session at 1.2470;\n\n- USDJPY. 60% of analysts had expected this pair to break the 108.70 resistance and the dollar to strengthen to the level of 111.65. The breakthrough occurred, however, the volatility of the Japanese currency was surprisingly low, and the growth of the pair stopped at the height of 109.37, after which it returned to where it started on Monday, to the zone of 108.40;  \n\n– cryptocurrencies. Some experts, trying to improve the status of Bitcoin as a safe haven asset, convince us that digital gold can become a safe haven for investors on a par with real gold. Thus, specialists of the management company VanEck Global concluded that \the correlation of Bitcoin with gold has reached an unprecedented level\ against the background of the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIndeed, the quotes of both assets are now growing. The XAUUSD and BTCUSD charts show that since March 16, 2020, the gold has risen by 16%, while Bitcoin has grown by as much as 55%. However, if you move just 4 days and start counting not from March 16, but from March 20, the picture will be completely different: the gold has grown by almost 14%, but the increase in the price of Bitcoin over the past three weeks was equal to ... zero.\nThis suggests that with its ultra-volatility, bitcoin remains a great tool for short-term speculation. But to use it as a safe haven and, even more so, an object for investment, is still questionable. By the way, analysts from VanEck Global agree with this, noting that they only meant a short period of time. In the long term, the correlation between XAUUSD and BTCUSD remains quite low.\nIn our previous forecast, we noted that, starting from March 20, the main cryptocurrency is unsuccessfully trying to gain a foothold above the $7,000 level. The past week was no exception. The bulls broke through this resistance on April 06 and even reached the height of $7,440, but they again lost their positions on Friday, and the pair fell to the $6,850-6,900 zone.\nAs for the total capitalization of the crypto market, it has not changed much over the week and is around $193 billion. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has also not changed, it still indicates the presence of strong fear in the market, having risen by just one point over the week, from 14 to 15.\nSuch top altcoins as Ripple (XRPUSD), Litecoin (LTCUSD) and Ethereum (ETHUSD) followed in the wake of the main cryptocurrency, but, in contrast, they were still in the green zone in the afternoon of Friday, April 10, showing a weekly increase from 5% (Litecoin and Ripple) to 10% (Ethereum).\n\n\nAs for the forecast for the coming week, summarizing the opinions of a number of experts, as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis, we can say the following:\n\n- EURUSD. Needless to say, the situation with the coronavirus epidemic in the United States is very difficult, and the economy of this country is teetering on the verge of a deep depression. To support its producers, the Fed has launched a quantitative easing program and, starting on March 16, has already purchased $1.19 trillion in Treasury bonds. The regulator will buy more securities worth $150 billion next week, which will continue to put pressure on the dollar. This is why 65% of experts expect the EURUSD uptrend to continue. The resistance levels are 1.1000, and 1.1240 1.1150.\nOn the other hand, the dollar is still the best currency during the crisis. It was this fact that stopped its active sales last week and is quite capable, according to the remaining 35% of analysts, to reverse the trend to the south again. The targets are 1.1100 and 1.1175;\nOne can understand what the indicators show just by looking at the charts of the pair. On D1, everything is quite colorful¬: there are about the same amounts of green, red and neutral gray colors. On H4, of course, green dominates, but 25% of the oscillators are already in the overbought zone.\nAs for the macroeconomic indicators, one should first of all pay attention to the retail sales and the number of initial unemployment claims in the US, which will be known on April 15 and April 16, respectively. Also, the data on China's GDP will help to assess the impact of the coronavirus on the economy, which will be released on Friday April 17;\n\n- GBPUSD. The British currency is now in good demand due to the difference between the rates for the pound and the dollar in the interbank lending market. However, everything can change in an instant. That is why experts' forecasts cannot be brought to any common denominator: 40% vote for the pair's growth, 35% – for its fall, and 25% simply shrug their shoulders.\nThe pair is in the side channel for the second week, holding in the range of 1.2200-1.2485, and it will start from its upper border on Monday, April 13. Graphical analysis on H4 shows its further growth to the horizon of 1.2600 and a subsequent fall to the support of 1.2200. The range of fluctuations is slightly larger on D1: first rising to the height of 1.2650, and then falling to the level of 1.2175. The situation with the indicators is generally similar to the readings on the EURUSD, 25% of the oscillators on both timeframes indicate that the pair is overbought;\n\n- USDJPY. The number of dollars in the global financial system, the yield on the US Treasury bonds, stock indices and oil quotes, the state of the economy of China - all these factors affect the attractiveness of the yen as a safe haven currency. The zero result of the USDJPY pair last week indicates that the market has not yet decided what to do with the Japanese currency, buy or sell. Most likely, we should not expect any independent movements from this pair, and its dynamics will reflect the overall market mood relative to the US dollar.\nMeanwhile, 60% of experts vote for a further weakening of the dollar and the fall of the pair to around 107.00. The next support is in the 104.75-105.15 zone. The alternative view is supported by 40% of analysts. Resistance levels are 109.35, 110.15 and 111.70;  \n\n– cryptocurrencies. According to the Head of UnionBank, Edwin Bautista, the transition of the banking sector to cryptocurrency against the background of the coronavirus pandemic looks very realistic. If the situation in the currency market does not stabilize, this measure will be the only one that will save the situation and keep the economy running. \Now almost all products are paid for online. We may see a period of complete rejection of fiat money in cash. If banks support the initiative of small regulators who already cooperate with cryptocurrency companies, the industry will reach a new level,\ Bautista believes.\nBut the statement of the Head of UnionBank is at least a medium-term forecast. And what awaits us in the near future? Mid-April is the beginning of the corporate reporting season. And the indicators of both individual companies and entire sectors of the economy are very likely to be extremely low. The Fed and the ECB continue to flood the fire with cheap liquidity, which will cause a powerful wave of inflation.\nIn such a situation, and especially if there is an excess mass of fiat money, speculators may again decide to play the card of Bitcoin as a safe haven currency. In this case, Bitcoin will soon not just break the $7,000 and $7,400 levels, but also aim above the $8,000 mark. 60% of experts vote for this development.\nThere is, of course, the opposite, the bearish scenario, supported by 40% of analysts. And it also depends largely on what will happen in the US, where class-action lawsuits were filed a week ago against four major Bitcoin exchanges and seven ICO projects, including Binance, BitMex and EOS. These lawsuits allege possible violations of U.S. law by the defendants, including the rules for the issuance and circulation of securities. And if the SEC (US Securities and Exchange Commission) grabs this case with a dead bulldog grip, Bitcoin will quickly break through the support of $6,700, and we will again see the pair in the region of $6,000.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nNordFX Analytical Group\n\n\nNotice: These materials should not be deemed a recommendation for investment or guidance for working on financial markets: they are for informative purposes only.

  content : What application do you use to call friends and colleagues during quarantine?\n\nSurely it's Zoom! The number it’s users increased to 200 million in March 2020. \n\nBut did you know that recently Elon Musk prohibited SpaceX employees from using Zoom because of “significant security and privacy issues”? He recommended to use email and phones instead of it. And he is not the only one who did so. NASA also forbade its employees from using Zoom for the same reasons.\n\nWhy did it happen?\n\nIn mid-March, when the number of users of the service started to grow very quickly, it seemed that the only problem could be the deterioration in the functioning of the application. But, as it turned out, the problems were much more serious. At first it became known that Zoom leaked users data, and then - it became clear that the application is easy to crack. In particular, Singapore authorities banned schools from holding school lessons in Zoom, after one of the lessons was cracked by hackers. \n\nThat was nice while it lasted.\n\nAs the coronavirus plunged the world into chaos, forcing entire states to isolate itselfs, Zoom has become the most important communication tool. The service became so popular that it took the first place among all the free apps in the App Store, beating Google, WhatsApp and even TikTok. \n\nThe financial component has also been affected by the popularity. The company’s stock were lifted on 143% since the IPO and on 44% over the past month. The company's capitalization reached $ 42 billion, and the fortune of Zoom’s CEO, Eric Yuan, reached $ 5.5 billion.\n\nIs it safe to use Zoom now?\n\nAt the moment, it is difficult to say whether it is worth using the Zoom application in case of you don’t want to lose your data or make public your communication with other person. But the CEO of Zoom, Eric Yuan, claims that he is already making every effort to ensure the high level of application security.\n\nECOS uses additional security features to protect user data, meets the PSI DSS and GDPR requirements and ensures that customers' personal data cannot be leaked. We advise you to use the products of only those companies that you really trust.,

  content : Before the coronavirus pandemic, economists expected that the world economy will grow by about three percent in 2020, but COVID-19 turned their predictions to dust. Now, as Bloomberg estimated, the coronavirus will cost the world's economy $5,5 trillion. It’s three times more than the GDP of Russia and more than the GDP of Germany (the largest economy in Europe).\n\nThe amount of $ 5.5 trillion is still preliminary and may change, but it is now clear that coronavirus will be very expensive.\n\nFor example, the size of the US budget aid package is still under discussion, but it is known that it is definitely more than $ 10 billion, but less than $ 50 billion, which Donald Trump recently spoke about. At the same time, it became known that US authorities are ready to inject about $ 4 trillion into the US financial system to stabilize the economy.\n\nAccording to European economists, the EU will have to spend about $ 350 billion to eliminate the consequences of one-month quarantine. This money will be spent in order to support healthcare, people and business. Such measures will help to slow down and stop the epidemic, maintain the financial stability and aid small and medium-sized enterprises bankruptcy. \n\nAs for the economy of China (the second economy of the world), it has already suffered losses in the amount of $ 143.1 billion, or about 1% of the country's GDP, according to the Taihe analytical center.\n\nSince the US, China and the EU account for two thirds of the world's economic activity, their recession will be enough to slow down the entire global economy. And if we take into account the threat of falling prices for oil and metals, which would affect the commodity-dependent economies, the picture becomes more depressing.\n\nThe period of instability of public financial systems and national currencies is an excellent time to draw the attention to digital money and alternative sources of income.
